## brainCloud at GDC!

It's our favorite time of the year. No, not because of the refreshing -40 degree temperatures of Canada's Capital - though that's swell - but rather because we can _escap__e_ the cold for a week of fun in San Francisco!

So, if you're going to be at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco **March 2nd - 6th**, be sure to drop by and say "Hello".  We'd love to meet, discuss your game, get feedback on the platform -- maybe even share a drink or two!

We are there for the whole week - but the easiest places to find us will be:

- **Wednesday - Friday** - we'll be at **Booth 2444** on the **GDC** **Expo Floor**.  We will be easy to find - we are way, way back in the far right-hand corner! Best booth in the house - ulp! :)
- **Thursday 4pm-5pm** - we'll be in **Room 302, South Hall**, giving a session on [Juicing F2P Revenue Using Cloud Tech](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session/juice-your-f2p-revenue-using-cloud-tech-without-advertising-presented-by-braincloud) - be sure to check it out!

We're also out and about the rest of the week. Some of the events we're attending include the **Vesuvio Party on Monday Night** and the **Ontario Social** on **Thursday Night.**  Drop us a note at "sales at getbraincloud.com" to meet up.

Hope to see you there!
