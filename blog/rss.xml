            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, folks,</p><p>As you may have seen in the trades, Amazon has recently announced the imminent deprecation of GameSparks to their current customers and partners.</p><p>We really like the tech and people at GameSparks and are sorry to see it go (really!). That said, we want to assure all GameSparks customers and partners that brainCloud can offer all developers (from hobbyists, startups, and big studios alike) an alternative to ensure efficient and full migration to prevent downtime for their players.</p><p>As most of you know, we launched brainCloud in <strong>2014</strong> and have been supporting all kinds of indies and big studios since then. We’ve also recently been working as a solution integrator in collaboration with Amazon Game Tech to assist&nbsp;GameSparks deprecation efforts and existing GameSparks customer migration.</p><p>brainCloud has a robust, comparable feature set that includes popular GameSparks features like Player and Game Management, Cloud Scripts, Leaderboards, Achievements, Messaging, Virtual Goods &amp; Currencies, and Real-time features like Lobbies, Matchmaking, Notifications, and Chat.</p><p>That said, brainCloud also has advanced features not implemented in GameSparks like Custom Room &amp; Relay Servers for real-time multiplayer, Tournaments, Blockchain Integration, Segments, Profanity Filters, Pricing and Promotion features, Playback Streams and connectivity to virtually any data collection or storage application through our Datastream service.</p><p>And of course, brainCloud supports all popular mobile and console platforms, including built-in Oculus support. We even have APIs to help migrate your users over to our back-end. And of particular interest to ex-GameSparks folks, we are happy to announce that <em><strong>Amazon GameLift integration will be added to brainCloud this fall!</strong></em></p><p>All of this is available via a variety of licensing options that range from monthly BaaS subscriptions all the way up to private and platform licensing. All with world-class support and available professional services.</p><p>We encourage all existing GameSparks customers to check out brainCloud and let us know how we can help you migrate and grow your games on all platforms. We are here to help. Just sign up - brainCloud is free during development!</p><p>Happy Coding,</p><p>Paul from brainCloud.<br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing comprehensive changes to iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and tvOS 14.5 that will require apps to&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ask users for their permission</a>&nbsp;to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p><p>At first glance, this seems like something that would mostly affect apps that are using user data for advertising-based monetization — but in truth, the implications are deeper than that.</p><p><em>For the record, we at&nbsp;<a href="https://getbraincloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>brainCloud</em></a> -- very much appreciate and advocate for user privacy. All user data associated with a brainCloud app is private to that app — the data is not aggregated or shared across apps or companies in any way. So if your app is using brainCloud without 3rd party authentication, you can feel confident that that data is not being shared in any way.</em></p><p>That said, brainCloud does support authentication-based integrations with third party providers — most importantly Facebook.</p><p>The Frequently Asked Questions from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple page linked above</a> clarify their guidance in this area:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/facebookL1-8b9424a79f40a672acb18419b183fc86.png" width="878" height="1132" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By this interpretation, just offering a classic Facebook Account login for your app — which is prety standard practice — requires you to get the user’s permission for tracking across apps and websites owned by other companies. The rationale is that your app may not be sharing the data — but Facebook itself certainly is.</p><p>Aside from Facebook’s objections to these changes (we don’t want to get into that) — Facebook has offered a recommended technical solution — they have extended their Facebook Login feature to include a new <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limited Login Mode</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/facebookL-554823f56c749f63285ccdc72bbe99ac.png" width="1600" height="1114" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So — Limited Login mode seems like a pretty good solution to this problem. There is a pretty big limitation here though.&nbsp;<strong><em>If users opt for the Limited Login mode, the app will not have access to the Graph API</em></strong>.</p><p>For games and social apps — this is a pretty big limitation. It means that the app (and backend services like brainCloud that act on it’s behalf) will&nbsp;<strong><em>lose the ability to query Facebook for the user’s friends</em></strong>. This will have a huge impact on games that depend upon those sorts of social interactions for engagement and monetization.</p><p>It is therefore highly recommended that games pop-up their own informational message before Apple’s built-in pop-up, to educate the user on any features that may become unavailable as a consequence of their choice.</p><p>Another issue is that the identification information returned from the new Limited Login mode is different than with the Classic Login. This means that&nbsp;<em>backend services, like brainCloud, need to implement changes to work with this new mode</em>. The silver lining is that the underlying id of the user remains the same between the two modes — so a user who flips back and forth between the two modes can still be associated with the same back-end account — phew!</p><p><strong><em>We at brainCloud are working hard to incorporate the necessary changes — and will be releasing brainCloud 4.7 with Facebook Limited Login mode before the end of March 2021.</em></strong></p><p>A few more details about the changes in brainCloud 4.7:</p><ul><li>Full Support for&nbsp;<em>Facebook Limited Login</em>&nbsp;mode across the authentication + identity APIs. The same user using either mode will be linked to the same underlying brainCloud profile.</li><li>brainCloud will automatically handle the loss of the Graph API for Limited Login mode users — so for example, users will simply appear to have no Facebook friends (instead of the client app having to deal with errors).</li><li>Coincidentally, brainCloud 4.7 will include new support for Steam and Playstation Network friends — so apps can extend their friend support in other areas.</li><li>brainCloud already supports self-managed&nbsp;<a href="http://getbraincloud.com/api/capi/friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friend APIs</a>. See AddFriends(), ListFriends(), etc.</li></ul><p>We hope that this helps to clarify the impact of these changs to iOS 14.5, and how brainCloud can help your apps to adapt.</p><p>Happy Coding!</p>]]></content:encoded>

All good now!</p></div></div><p>Hi folks,</p><p>We are currently tracking some oddities in the reliability of the brainCloud libraries running in <strong>Unity 2019.X</strong> on <strong>iOS devices</strong>.</p><p><em>Updates</em>:</p><ol><li><strong>We have confirmed that this issue is limited to iOS only</strong> (edit: also probably tvOS). It does not occur on Android, Mac, Windows or WebGL.</li><li><strong>A Unity Rep has confirmed the defect, and that they are working on a fix</strong>. See this <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/ios-post-request-with-raw-data.690514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity Forum thread</a>.</li><li>The defect now appears in Unity's Issue Tracker - click and add your +1 - <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unitywebrequest-errors-large-packets-with-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unitywebrequest-errors-large-packets-with-examples</a></li><li>Further updates in this <a href="https://forums.getbraincloud.com/topic/25/important-unity-2019-x-on-mobile-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainCloud Forum Post</a>.</li></ol><p><strong><em>Executive Summary: We highly advise developers to stick with Unity 2018.X until further notice.</em></strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="symptoms">Symptoms<a class="hash-link" href="#symptoms" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The symptom is that requests are being sent to brainCloud, and occasionally rejected with what brainCloud calls a <strong><em>signature error</em></strong>.</p><p>Signature errors are flagged if the content of the message that brainCloud receives doesn't match the MD5 that has been calculated for the message. They generally mean that either the client had the wrong secret (likely a hacking attempt) or the message content has been tampered with (also likely a man-in-the-middle hacking attempt).</p><p>In this case, neither of these has occurred - rather, the message content has been corrupted somehow by Unity's libraries (we suspect a combination of the <code>UnityWebRequest</code> and/or <code>UploadHandler</code> classes).</p><p>This doesn't happen all-the-time... (in fact, it very rarely occurs if requests are less than 2K). But we're seeing it happening quite often with requests that are <strong>7K or greater in size</strong>.</p><p>After enough of these errors occur, the <code>UnityWebRequest</code> class is locking up - causing the brainCloud client library to stop functioning properly - requiring the app to be terminated.</p><p><em>Note - the good news is that brainCloud's servers catch this issue and prevent the bad message from corrupting your data. The bad news is that a client experiencing this issue might have to retry several times to send a request - impairing client performance.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reproducing-the-error">Reproducing the error<a class="hash-link" href="#reproducing-the-error" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We have only been able to reproduce this error in <strong>Unity 2019.1.X</strong> <em>(as well as 2019.2.0b5 (alpha) and 2019.3.0a5 (beta))</em> and only when running on iOS devices.</p><p><em>We do have reason to suspect that Android devices may also be impacted (but we haven't had time to test + prove that yet). <strong>Update: We have since tested on Android and cannot reproduce the problem. So this appears to be an iOS-only issue.</strong></em></p><p>Certainly, the same code running from the editor on Mac and Windows workstations seems to run just fine.</p><p>And certainly, the same brainCloud libraries (with test code) running under Unity 2018.X runs fine as well. <em>Also, our C++/Objective-C libraries are still running</em> <em>fine</em> <em>under iOS - this issue is limited to Unity.</em></p><p>We have noted, as per their 2019 release notes, that Unity seems to be making significant changes to their iOS communications.</p><ul><li>2019.1 Release notes<ul><li>iOS: UnityWebRequest will use new backend based on NSURLSession. Old NSUrlConnection backed is still available (commented out in trampoline)</li></ul></li><li>2019.1.4 Release notes:<ul><li>iOS: Fixed larger than 2k payloads not sent by UnityWebRequest when HTTP/2 (1146305, 1152777)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="recommendation">Recommendation<a class="hash-link" href="#recommendation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong><em>For now, we recommend that developers limit their production iOS builds to Unity 2018.X or earlier.</em></strong></p><p>We are constructing a limited function test app that we will submit to Unity when we report this defect. We will keep the community posted as to how that progresses.</p><p><em>Update - you can see the</em> <strong><em>brainCloud forum post</em></strong><em>, with repro code and details,</em> <a href="https://forums.getbraincloud.com/topic/25/important-unity-2019-x-on-mobile-devices/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>In the meantime, we thought it best that our community have a heads up regarding this potential problem.</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience and hope that through working with Unity, we can get a solution to you ASAP!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Information</p><p><em>This article has been updated to include September 2020 tweaks to RTT pricing.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-plan-plan">The Plan plan<a class="hash-link" href="#the-plan-plan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><strong>brainCloud 4</strong> is fast approaching - and it is bringing a slew of new capabilities to the platform, including the official release of <strong>RTT</strong> (Real-time events, Chat, Messaging, Online Matchmaking, Lobbies, Presence and more!) as well as brand-new <strong>Hosting</strong> capabilities (Relay Servers and Room Servers).</p><p>As these new capabilities bring additional costs to running our infrastructure - we will be introducing revised pricing plans in coordination with brainCloud 4.</p><p>The good news is that if you aren't using these features, nothing much changes -- in fact, we've <em>revised the API pricing tiers downward</em>, so <strong>your overall costs should go down!</strong></p><p>For the folks taking advantage of these great new capabilities, we have added new <strong>Plus</strong> plans, and have worked hard to keep the pricing reasonable and in-line with the costs to provide the service.</p><p>We are also introducing new discounted <strong>Lite</strong> plans - perfect for apps with lower usage requirements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="v4-plans">V4 Plans<a class="hash-link" href="#v4-plans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When 4.0 launches, the new plan lineup will look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Development (Free)</strong> - access to all features, <em>except hosting</em>. Limited to 100 DAU, 1000 accounts. Includes 10 CCx.</li><li><strong>Development Plus! ($5 /month)</strong> - All features, <strong>including hosting</strong>. Limited to 200 DAU, 2000 accounts. Includes 20 CCx.</li><li><strong>Lite ($15 /month)</strong> - Core features. Includes 1M API.</li><li><strong>Lite Plus ($25 /month)</strong> - Core features + <strong>RTT</strong> + <strong>Hosting</strong>. Includes 1M API, 50 CCx.</li><li><strong>Standard ($30 /month)</strong> - Core features. Includes 6M API.</li><li><strong>Standard Plus ($50 /month)</strong> - Core features + <strong>RTT</strong> + <strong>Hosting</strong>. Includes 6M API, 100 CCx.</li><li><strong>Business ($99 /month)</strong> - Core + <strong>Enterprise</strong> features. Includes 10M API.</li><li><strong>Business Plus ($199 /month)</strong> - <strong>All features</strong>. Includes 15M API, 250 CCx.<br>We are confident that we have a plan to fit every app!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="api-usage">API Usage<a class="hash-link" href="#api-usage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As we were putting together our new set of plans, we decided to simplify and standardize the API Usage Tier Pricing.</p><p>All V4 plans use the <em>same</em> discounting tiers as they scale (it used to differ by plan). So no matter what plan you start with, as you get to 15M total API calls for the month, the cost per M drops to $10.00.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/APICallsTable4-0bd9aa3a750f83c139de9d2752411c45.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/APICallsTable4-0bd9aa3a750f83c139de9d2752411c45.png" width="1021" height="521" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>One side effect of this standardization is that the cost of additional usage for <strong>Business Plan</strong> customers now starts at $10.25 / M API, instead of $10.00 / M API from the old plan. To make up for this, we have bumped up the <strong>Business Plan</strong> to include <strong>10M API</strong> for free (instead of 9M) - so it is a net win.</p><p>We have also made our API Usage pricing tiers more aggressive. In the old plans, you needed to hit 300M+ API calls to get to $9.90 / M pricing. <em>In the new plans, we drop the price to $9.75 / M API at just 25M+ API calls.</em></p><p><strong><em>We have accelerated the API discounting across the board, resulting in savings of 5-10% at high usage levels.</em></strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-plus-plans">New Plus Plans<a class="hash-link" href="#new-plus-plans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The new <strong>Plus</strong> plans make <strong>RTT</strong> and <strong>Hosting</strong> features available to apps at all usage levels.</p><p>Features available to Plus plans include:</p><ul><li>Async Match with RTT</li><li>Chat</li><li>Lobbies</li><li>Online Matchmaking</li><li>Presence</li><li>Real-time Events</li><li>Real-time Messaging</li><li>Relay Server Hosting</li><li>Room Server Hosting</li></ul><p>And more!</p><p>We have worked hard to keep the incremental costs of the Plus plans low - so that as many developers as possible can integrate these great new features into their apps.</p><p><em>Note - Plus plans are subject to RTT Usage and Hosting Usage costs. More details in the sections that follow.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-lite-plans">New Lite Plans<a class="hash-link" href="#new-lite-plans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A frequent request has been for lower-cost, lower-usage plans.</p><p>We are pleased to present our new <strong>Lite</strong> and <strong>Lite Plus</strong> plans. These plans offer the <em>all the same features</em> as their <strong>Standard</strong> plan equivalents, but at lower 1M API usage levels.</p><p>These plans, which start at just $15 and $25 /month respectively, are great for indie developers, the development of smaller experimental apps, and even for more ambitious apps in the long-tail phase of their product lifecycle.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rtt-usage">RTT Usage<a class="hash-link" href="#rtt-usage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>brainCloud's RTT features require a nailed-up TCP or WebSocket connection for every client device. The costs to brainCloud are in <strong>maintaining connections (CCx)</strong> from our servers, and <strong>delivering</strong> the millions of real-time events to your users as they participate in chat, messaging, lobbies, etc.</p><p>To account for this utilization, we simply convert these resources to API counts.</p><p>Every RTT plan comes with a number of <strong>Concurrent Connections</strong> (<strong>CCx</strong>) that are <strong>free</strong> <em>per hour</em>. For example, the Standard Plus plan includes 100 CCx. That means that a peak of 100 Users can be <em>concurrently</em> online without additional CCx usage fees. Assuming your average play session is 12 minutes, that might actually equate to 500 users per hour, or 12K users per day. And that's if RTT is enabled for the full time that users are in your app. <em>Optimize your app to only initialize RTT when you need it, and 100 CCx could equate to thousands of users per hour.</em></p><p>Above that, apps are charged at a rate of 10 API calls per CCx per hour. So - lets say your app was averaging double that - or 200 CCx. The additional costs would be 100 x 10 API/CCx x 24 hours x 30 days = 720,000 API counts. At ~ $10 / M API, that's about $7.20 in usage.</p><p>The other component of RTT Usage is <strong>event delivery</strong>. RTT is great for chat and lobby operations - where one operation may fan out to dozens (or thousands) of recipients. That's great functionality wise - but those deliveries can really add up!</p><p>The good news is that RTT is very efficient at delivering events - so we are charging at a bulk ratio of 100:1 - that is, your app is charged just <strong>1 API count for each 100 events</strong> delivered!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hosting-usage">Hosting Usage<a class="hash-link" href="#hosting-usage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>brainCloud now supports hosting of <em>Relay Servers</em> and custom <em>Room Servers</em>. This really opens up the sort of experiences that can be accommodated in a pure brainCloud environment.</p><p>The good news is that you aren't charged for API calls / messaging / etc to your hosted servers -- even if the server is one of our Relay Servers (using our new Relay Protocol).</p><p>That said, we do of course need to pass along the cloud costs of hosting the servers, and the data transfer usage associated with it, from the cloud provider.</p><p>For pricing, brainCloud is simply marking up the hosting costs by 15%, and adding 1.5 cents per hour for managing the servers.</p><p>To help keep costs low, brainCloud will automatically spin up / down servers as required. There are a complete set of parameters that can be customized to allow Teams to fine tune the best balance between server cost and performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="and-those-are-the-new-plans">And those are the new plans!<a class="hash-link" href="#and-those-are-the-new-plans" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Those are the billing changes for v 4.0.</p><p>We appreciate that brainCloud's adherence to elastic pricing can seem a bit complicated. It is certainly more complicated than traditional per-MAU pricing. But in the great majority of cases, it is also much better value.</p><p>Our overall goal when designing our pricing models is to ensure that the pricing you are charged reflects the costs that we incur in providing the service.</p><p>We feel this approach aligns our interests. The more server resources your apps consume, the higher our costs, and the higher the price to you. But the more efficiently you can build your app, the lower our costs, and the lower the pricing for you. It's win:win - and we are on the same side!</p><p>If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us via the Green Chat widget. We are always happy to hear from you!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With release 3.6.5, brainCloud is breaking away from the singletons that were previously a key aspect of our client libraries.</p><p>We thought we'd take a moment to discuss the pros and cons of the design, and explain where and why we are going a different route.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To start, lets review the purpose and design of the client library.</p><p>The goal of the client library is to <em>simplify development of brainCloud-based applications</em>. It does this by:</p><ul><li>providing local implementation of brainCloud client calls (instead of forcing the client app to use Raw REST calls)</li><li>automating communications with the server (bundling of messages for efficiency, packet security, and more)</li><li>performing standard error handling</li></ul><p>The library is actually organized into two major components:</p><ul><li>the brainCloud Client Library - a pure, platform-independent wrapper of the brainCloud client-server protocol</li><li>the brainCloud Wrapper - simplifies aspects of the API (especially authentication) by incorporating more client-side functionality, like saving and restoring anonymousIds and profileIds.</li></ul><p>Use of the client library is required by apps. Use of the wrapper is highly recommended, but optional.&nbsp;<em>Note - originally we only had the client library. The wrapper was added later as an aid to app developers.</em> </p><hr><p>Delving deeper into the design, you can see that the client object maintains a list of services and internal components that work together to provide the client functionality. The wrapper on the other hand is quite simple, and merely adds an additional simplification layer to the API.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/braincloud-client-api-architecture-details-a91ef7c8f27f52a78ba75b808797b9c8.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-details-a91ef7c8f27f52a78ba75b808797b9c8.png" width="661" height="541" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Of significance here is the use of singletons. There are two singletons in play - one for the client, and one for the wrapper. Not only are the singletons used as the reference from the client to the wrapper and/or client library objects - but they are also used for communications between BrainCloudWrapper and BrainCloudClient.</p><p>In hindsight, although our intentions were good - this usage of singletons was a mistake.</p><p>The cons (as we now see them) are:</p><ul><li>Complicates the client code (calling the static class methods to retrieve a reference to the wrapper and or client object is more painful than using a direct global of some sort)</li><li>Complicates the documented code examples</li><li>Restricts a client to have one-and-only-one connection to the brainCloud server&nbsp;<!-- -->[ <em>this is a crippling restriction for some use cases - couch co-op anyone?</em>&nbsp;]</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-fix">The fix<a class="hash-link" href="#the-fix" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>And so, we are fixing this.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/braincloud-client-api-architecture-new-3557e789930ecf9b75c70cd3f54173ba.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-new-3557e789930ecf9b75c70cd3f54173ba.png" width="369" height="419" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>The changes to the new client libraries are three-fold:</p><ul><li><code>BrainCloudWrapper</code>&nbsp;objects now have their own reference to their associated <code>BrainCloudClient</code>&nbsp;companions</li><li><code>BrainCloudWrapper</code>&nbsp;objects also now provide direct methods for accessing the client services:&nbsp;you no longer have to call <em>wrapper&nbsp;→ client&nbsp;→ service&nbsp;→ operation</em>, instead it is simply <em>wrapper&nbsp;→ service&nbsp;→ operation</em></li></ul><p>The result is that instead of your client code looking like this:</p><p><code>BrainCloudWrapper.Instance.GetBC().LeaderboardService.ListAllLeaderboards( ApiSuccess, ApiError);</code></p><p>It can look like this:</p><p><code>_bc.LeaderboardService.ListAllLeaderboards( ApiSuccess, ApiError);</code></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-changes">The Changes<a class="hash-link" href="#the-changes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>So - more flexibility and clearer code? What's the catch?</p><p>The catch is that you need to make a few changes to your client to get this goodness. For new apps it's no big deal at all - this could be a pain for existing apps though, so we are still including a legacy singleton mode in the client libraries - but that needs to be specifically enabled.</p><p><em><strong>Update: Legacy Singleton Mode has been removed from brainCloud client libraries beginning with 4.0.</strong></em> </p><p>Here are the steps to getting your app working using the updated libraries</p><ol><li>Grab the latest brainCloud client library from the portal via the&nbsp;<strong>Team | Client Libs</strong> page.</li><li>Create an instance of&nbsp;<code>BrainCloudWrapper</code> and save it to a global accessible throughout your client app. In our documentation examples we use&nbsp;<!-- -->_<!-- -->bc, but it can be anything</li><li>Adjust any client code to use this new reference - try searching and replacing<ol><li>"BrainCloudWrapper.Client."&nbsp;→ "<!-- -->_<!-- -->bc."</li><li>"BrainCloudClient.Instance."&nbsp;→ "<!-- -->_<!-- -->bc."</li></ol></li></ol><p>And that's about it.</p><p>Note - you can optionally specify a <!-- -->_<em>wrapperName</em>&nbsp;to use creating the wrapper. This name will be used as a key when storing data about the session, like the anonymousId and profileId.</p><p>You only need to specify the <em>_<!-- -->wrapperName</em> if you are implementing a client with multiple concurrent connections to the brainCloud server (to help keep the session data separate). <em><strong>In particular, if you are updating an existing app, do not specify a profile-name - this ensures that the user does not lose their saved profile references when they upgrade to the latest version of your app!</strong></em></p><div class="language-csharp

All scores are stored by version in <em>Leaderboard Entry</em> objects.</li></ul><p>Special rules:</p><ul><li>The same&nbsp;<em>tournament template</em>&nbsp;may be used by&nbsp;<em>multiple leaderboards</em>. This of course creates a separate tournament per leaderboard.</li><li>A leaderboard may also attach&nbsp;<em>multiple tournament templates</em>. This is useful for cases where you want to have both free and paid versions of a tournament, that act upon the same set of scores.

If the player is not enrolled, returns details of&nbsp;<em>all</em> the tournament configs associated with the leaderboard</li><li><em>Join Tournament</em>&nbsp;- all tournaments must be joined before you can submit scores to them. Joining a tournament involves specifying the leaderboard that anchors the tournament, and the&nbsp;<code>tCode</code>&nbsp;of the tournament <!-- -->[template]<!-- --> that you are joining.&nbsp;<em>An entry fee will automatically be deducted from the player's currency balance if required.</em></li><li><em>Post Tournament Score</em>&nbsp;- posts an score to the tournament leaderboard. Note that you must pass in the epoch time that the game round started in, to ensure that the score is eligible. <em>Note that there are&nbsp;several versions of this operation (see the API for details).</em></li><li><em>View Current Reward</em>&nbsp;- returns the player's standing in the currently active tournament, and the reward they can expect to receive if they keep this rank.</li><li><em>View Reward</em>&nbsp;- returns the players reward for a completed tournament, and whether it has already been claimed. Will return an error if the player is not enrolled in the tournament.</li><li><a href="/braincloud-apiref/api/capi/event/getevents"><em>Check For Events</em></a> - query the brainCloud events queue to see if any Tournament Completion events have arrived</li><li><em>Claim Tournament Reward</em>&nbsp;- claims the rewards for a completed tournament, incrementing appropriate player balances (currencies, etc.).</li></ul><p>For more information&nbsp;on these interactions, see the <a href="/braincloud-apiref/api/capi/tournament">Tournament API</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phases-and-states">Phases and States<a class="hash-link" href="#phases-and-states" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><em>Tournament States</em> are used to organize the larger tournament lifecycle. They determine when tournaments are active, processing award calculations, and available for award clams.</p><p><em>Tournament Phases</em> help to micro-manage when players can join tournaments, post scores, etc. throughout the Active tournament state.</p><p>The following diagram summarizes the relationship between brainCloud tournament states and phases:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/Tournament-States-and-Phases-2cd5c52ab84e1537c8e8261fbe8914cb.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/Tournament-States-and-Phases-2cd5c52ab84e1537c8e8261fbe8914cb.png" width="767" height="587" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p><em>Note that brainCloud doesn't explicitly tell you the phase&nbsp;it is in - instead,&nbsp;it gives you information as to when registration starts and ends, when play starts and ends, etc.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="events-and-notifications">Events and Notifications<a class="hash-link" href="#events-and-notifications" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>A key goal of brainCloud's Global Tournaments system is to automate the tournaments interactions with players. As such, the system:</p><ul><li>Automatically rotates and cycles through tournament states and phases as per the schedule defined</li><li>Send events to players when the tournament has completed</li><li>Optionally sends push notifications and/or emails<ul><li>When a&nbsp;new tournament opens for registration (enrollment) - sent to previous tournament participants</li><li>When a new tournament opens for play (competition) - sent to previous and currently registered participants</li><li>When a tournament's competition phase is close to ending - sent to current participants</li><li>When another player beats their tournament score, bumping them down a rank - sent to current participants within 10 ranks of the player who posted the score</li><li>When a tournament completes and they're awards are ready to be claimed - sent to current participants. The system also sends an Event to the player's event queue.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/2017-01-29_23-22-52-c5d744f8262d702943e13f2d73cb4408.png"><img loading="lazy" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/2017-01-29_23-22-52-c5d744f8262d702943e13f2d73cb4408.png" width="847" height="710" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Note that you shouldn't blindly configure all notifications - especially the email-based notifications. Some recommendations:</p><ul><li>Obviously, do not configure both Tournament Registration start and Tournament Play start if your tournament doesn't have an exclusive registration period, or your players will get two back-to-back notifications, and be annoyed.</li><li>Be careful about configuring Email-based notifications - we've included the trigger points, but for most cases we would recommend that you mostly use them to announce that a tournament is complete and that the player should come collect their prize. It's also a handy opportunity to include info on other game offers, bonuses items to increase scores, etc.</li><li>Be aware that brainCloud does not yet support automated unsubscribes&nbsp;(coming soon)</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="special-scoring-notifications">Special: Scoring notifications<a class="hash-link" href="#special-scoring-notifications" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>There are two types of designers. Designers who think that scoring notifications are cool, and those that think they could get annoying very quickly. And they are both right.</p><p>To add the engagement of scoring notifications, hopefully without overwhelming the player, we've added the following rules:</p><ul><li>We'll only send a player&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;scoring notification per 24-hour period</li></ul><p>The are two additional rules that affect this:</p><ul><li>If you post a new score, we reset the notification clock. This means that engaged players&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;receive more than one notification in a 24 hour period, because they're actually responding to them.</li><li>We won't send the player a score update until at least 30 minutes after their last posted score (i.e. you don't want to receive a push notification&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>&nbsp;after exiting the game)</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bonus-features-auto-join-and-auto-reward">Bonus Features: Auto Join and Auto Reward<a class="hash-link" href="#bonus-features-auto-join-and-auto-reward" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Global Tournaments&nbsp;offer an incredible way to increase engagement and monetization with your players -&nbsp;but&nbsp;what if you are just looking for a quick way to automatically add rewards to your weekly leaderboards - without code changes?</p><p>Look no further - brainCloud has two new features that&nbsp;allow you to automate the key portions of the tournament processing:</p><ul><li><em>Auto Join</em> - Enables&nbsp;players to automatically join the tournament associated with a leaderboard, simply by posting a score to it (via the standard leaderboard PostScore method). Note that this only works for leaderboards that have <em>one-and-only-one tournament</em> associated with them - and that tournament must be <em>free</em>.</li><li><em>Auto Claim</em> - Causes tournament rewards to be automatically claimed by players during login. Note that the <em>[x]<!-- --> Enable Tournament Auto Claim check at login</em> compatibility flag&nbsp;must also be enabled on the Design | Core App Info | Advanced page of the portal</li></ul><p><em>Note - although we provide the Auto Join and Auto Claim features for convenience, in most cases we would definitely recommend that you implement the full tournament API. A key benefit to tournaments is engaging with your players - getting them excited about what they can win and adding that extra flourish as they claim their prizes. Auto Join and Auto Claim hide all that - minimizing&nbsp;the opportunity&nbsp;for extra player engagement.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features-availability-and-billing-notes">Features Availability and Billing Notes<a class="hash-link" href="#features-availability-and-billing-notes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Global Tournaments are available across all brainCloud subscription plans.</p><p>The basic API billing rules are in effect - 1 API count per API call, 1 API count per Push Notification, 1 API count per Email Sent</p><p>In addition, the following counts are added to offset the overheads of automated tournaments:</p><ul><li><em>Awards Calculation</em> - At the end of the tournament, 1&nbsp;Bulk API Count <em>per participant</em> is charged to cover the CPU load of processing results and sending events to the players</li><li><a href="/braincloud-apiref/api/capi/tournament/posttournamentscorewithresultsutc"><em>PostTournamentScoreWithResultsUTC()</em></a>&nbsp;- adds 1&nbsp;Bulk API count to cover the overhead of comparing the players previous and current tournament results, and determining whether to send notifications to displaced players. As compensation, however, returns the updated tournament results (essentially <a href="/braincloud-apiref/api/capi/leaderboard/getgloballeaderboardview">GetGlobalLeaderboardView()</a>), hopefully saving the app an API call in return.</li><li>Auto Claim - if the Auto-Claim feature is enabled, 0.5&nbsp;Bulk API Counts are&nbsp;added to each Authentication()</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Parse and who can you trust?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="parse-and-who-can-you-trust">Parse and who can you trust?<a class="hash-link" href="#parse-and-who-can-you-trust" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>On Thursday, Facebook dropped a <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/facebook-to-shut-down-parse-its-platform-for-mobile-developers/?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bomb</a>. They announced that they were <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shutting down&nbsp;Parse</a>, the Mobile&nbsp;Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) platform that they acquired in 2013.</p><p>Parse is one of brainCloud's competitors, and arguably the biggest and most established player in the BaaS industry. Even so, brainCloud doesn't&nbsp;run up against them <em>that</em> much because we&nbsp;have a richer, more specialized&nbsp;featureset that works better for our customer base.</p><p>In the wake of this event, it is inevitable that people are asking&nbsp;"What happened?" and "How can we trust any BaaS to build our business upon". To that end, I thought I'd put together a few thoughts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-was-parse-shut-down">Why was Parse shut down?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-was-parse-shut-down" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The internet is a-buzz with&nbsp;comments that <em>the business must have been failing</em>.</p><p>I don't buy that. The business case for the Backend-as-a-Service market&nbsp;is very strong, and Parse had a good product for the space they were aimed at. By all accounts, they had plenty of customers and an overall strong business. So why close it?</p><p>The answer is that Parse no longer aligned with the goals of it's parent company, Facebook.</p><p>At the time that Parse was acquired, Facebook was floundering. They had recently IPO'd, but hadn't figured out their mobile and advertising strategy. The stock was down, revenues were down - and they made a series of acquisitions hoping to strengthen and diversify their portfolio. Parse,&nbsp;well positioned as a platform for enabling mobile apps, seemed like a smart play to help them build up their mobile presence. And I'd say it was.</p><p>But now, almost three years later, things have changed. Facebook has totally turned it's ship around. It is now a <a href="http://marketingland.com/nielsen-top-apps-of-2015-dominated-by-facebook-google-apple-156694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">juggernaught in mobile</a>, has advertising sales through the roof, and is more focused than ever on building out its&nbsp;core product. In managing everything it is doing, Facebook needs to continually ask itself: "Is &lt;x<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> strategic to our overall success?"</p><p>And I think that's where Parse failed the test. Parse's business was probably $50-$100M per year. Healthy, for sure - heck, we'd take it! But that's just a drop in the bucket to Facebook (less than 1% of revenue!), which will net close to $20B this year. And yet, I'll bet that division&nbsp;had some of Facebook's best engineers!</p><p>And that's what it comes down to - Facebook said as much in their blog post. They are going to <strong><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"focus their resources elsewhere."</a></strong> I don't&nbsp;think this is the normal generic&nbsp;excuse that a company makes when they announce bad news - in this case, I believe that it is very <em>literally</em> what they are doing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-canyou-trust">Who can&nbsp;you trust?<a class="hash-link" href="#who-canyou-trust" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the wake of the Parse shut-down, a lot of people will be wondering how they can put their trust in any Backend-as-a-Service. After all, a ton of people probably chose Parse specifically because it was run by Facebook - a huge, incredibly successful organization, that&nbsp;was guaranteed to be around for years to come.</p><p>Here is my&nbsp;suggestion on the evaluation criteria to consider:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/Parse_and_who_can_you_trust_-0c00e342bbc3f65c9e1fd9b3e4e2c235.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="parse_and_who_can_you_trust_" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/Parse_and_who_can_you_trust_-0c00e342bbc3f65c9e1fd9b3e4e2c235.png" width="712" height="238" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><ol><li><em><strong>Feature Set</strong></em> - always&nbsp;start with the features&nbsp;- there is no point in going for a solution that doesn't meet your needs.</li><li><em><strong>Organization</strong></em> - consider&nbsp;the organization that develops it. Are they a long-standing, established business, that has earned a solid reputation in the marketplace?</li><li><em><strong>Funding</strong></em> - how is the company/product funded? <strong>Beware of purely VC-funded companies.</strong>&nbsp;A lot of BaaS vendors are early stage VC-funded - this makes for splashy million dollar announcements and marketing materials, but the funding comes with strings attached, in terms of <em>"You must succeed by &lt;x<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> or you will be shut down."</em></li><li><em><strong>Business Model</strong></em> -&nbsp;does the business model make sense? Is it easy to understand how the business would make money for the organization? If not, be wary - a _"too good to be true"_business model is often a sign of a last-ditch "hail mary" throw for success.</li><li><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em> - Does the product align with the strategic goals of the parent organization. No matter how good the product, Facebook has just proven that you are in danger if a clear alignment isn't there.</li></ol><p>Given this critera, how does brainCloud rate?</p><ol><li><em><strong>Feature Set</strong></em>&nbsp;- we pride ourselves on our features, and the rapid pace at which they are&nbsp;evolving. With brainCloud (especially in comparison to a lower-level offering&nbsp;like Parse), you spend <em>less time building features and more time using them</em>. And we match each new feature with a visual tool for configuring and managing it.brainCloud goes over-and-above the classic BaaS capabilities with support for Gamification (xp, milestones, quests, achievements, leaderboards, etc.), Segmented Push Notifications, Scheduled Cloud Code, Auto&nbsp;Promotions, Mobile Multiplayer, Shared User Accounts, External Authentication, Server-to-Server APIs, a dynamic DataStream Architecture, and much much more.</li><li><em><strong>Organization</strong></em> - brainCloud is built by <a href="http://www.bitheads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitHeads</a>, a 20-year old&nbsp;technology&nbsp;software developer based in Ottawa, Canada, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.playbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playBrains</a>, our game development subsidiary. bitHeads has earned a reputation as one of the top software development companies in Canada, and through the years has built award-winning products for Microsoft, Sony, Blackberry, Canada Post, Samsung, E<!-- -->*<!-- -->Trade, Nortel, Mitel, and hundreds of others.</li><li><em><strong>Funding</strong></em> - brainCloud is privately funded by bitHeads, its parent organization, with some assistance from various Canadian government programs. We are privately controlled, and thus no ultimatums.We started building brainCloud over four&nbsp;years ago, well before the term BaaS or MBaaS was a thing.&nbsp;We saw&nbsp;the value and opportunity in this market back then, and are determined to build the best product for it.</li><li><em><strong>Business Model</strong></em> - we don't give brainCloud away, but we do work to keep the cost of the service as low as possible. brainCloud is free for development (maximum 100 dau), but you pay starting at $30 / month once you go live. <em>This minimal charge ensures that every brainCloud customer is pulling their weight and paying their share of the costs for the service.</em> This allows us to offer lower prices than our competitors, while at the same time ensuring that&nbsp;<em>bitHeads can operate brainCloud indefinitely.</em><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/bc_parse_model-8deddf39ca9dee344316dc5cd0abac08.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="bc_parse_model" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/bc_parse_model-8deddf39ca9dee344316dc5cd0abac08.png" width="671" height="258" class="img_ev3q"></a>Contrast that with the models of some of our competitors, and ask yourselves how they can possibly be successful in the mid-to-long term? They have to charge their paid users more, and are basically betting that they will have enough high-volume customers to pay for the inevitably huge number of low-volume customers (that they subsidize for free). And some models are even crazier!&nbsp;<em>These are the&nbsp;sorts of bets that you make when you are desperate&nbsp;for your next round of VC funding, or looking to be bought</em>.</li><li><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em> - brainCloud arose because bitHeads was constantly building custom backend solutions for our customers. And we were building them over-and-over again, with largely the same features. For online casinos. Retail networks. Telecommunications. Mobile/Social games. For twenty years.Four years ago, we finally said, wait - what if we did this once, and productized it, so that we (nor anyone else) has to keep re-inventing the wheel? And thus brainCloud was born. It started as a small, separate team working within the company to build the core server system. We released the first apps on the platform almost three years ago - before we had a design portal with which to design and manage things (configuration was CSV and JSON&nbsp;back then).Today the team consists of twenty-ish people within the larger bitHeads/playBrains organization, together with the support teams to make that work. All services teams at bitHeads are aligned to delivering products and services around brainCloud.&nbsp;The custom apps and games that we build today are built upon brainCloud - it's our competitive advantage. And we continue to productize and evolve the platform based on the feedback of our great community of developers.There's no fear of alignment here - bitHeads <em>is</em> brainCloud.</li></ol><p>And there you have it - my take on Parse, and how bitHeads&nbsp;and brainCloud rate as a Backend-as-a-Server that you can trust. To our&nbsp;brainCloud customers today, thanks a bunch - rest assured, we are in this for the long haul.</p><p>And if this is your first exposure to brainCloud, please <a href="https://portal.braincloudservers.com/signup#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up</a> and take a look for free. If&nbsp;you take a good look at our features and tools, we think you'll realize the power of the system we've developed, and the passion of the folks building it.</p><p>Oh - and&nbsp;if you are looking to move from Parse, please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/W93BKYC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out this survey</a>. Filling it out will help us to prioritize the tools and support processes that we're developing to assist&nbsp;Parse migration.</p><p>Happy coding folks!</p><p>Paul.</p><p><em>(PS - And for all you Parse-based folks looking to move, feel free to reach out. Our services teams would be happy to help you move over to our platform!)</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="baas-for-single-player-games">BaaS for Single-Player Games<a class="hash-link" href="#baas-for-single-player-games" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>An interesting question was put to me today:</p><p><em>"Would it make sense to cloud-enable an existing, successf__ul, single-player&nbsp;mobile game?"</em></p><p>My gut reaction was "<strong>probably&nbsp;not</strong>". &nbsp;We know that the sweet spot for our Backend-as-a-Service is with <em>social and multiplayer games</em>, where a back-end is pretty much required. For those customers, pitching brainCloud is simply a question of Build vs. Buy.</p><p>That said, brainCloud offers a <!-- -->*<!-- -->lot<!-- -->*<!-- --> more than just multiplayer and social features - features that greatly aid in the management and monetization of any free-to-play game... &nbsp;so lets dig deeper and do the full analysis.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>First, a bit of background on the game in question:</p><ul><li>It's a freemium mobile game on <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong></li><li>The game is successful, and doing roughly 50K DAU, with about $0.02 ARPDAU</li><li>Monetization is via in-app-purchases for speeding up the accrual of key stats and in-game currencies - progressing the meta-game</li><li>There are no social features - no leaderboards, etc.</li><li>The game is integrated with no cloud tech, other than analytics and some advertising - so no cloud saves, etc...</li><li>It's a very small team - 1-3 devs really - so time is money</li></ul><p>So - what benefits cloud features have to offer a game like this? &nbsp;And do the benefits out-weigh the impact of adding the new monthly cloud service costs?</p><p>It's easy to argue that their player base will grow and become more engaged if you add cloud saves (so players can play across devices), social leaderboards (to compete against friends), published achievements, player vs. player challenges, etc... &nbsp;but it's impossible to predict (or later prove) what the monetary impact of those incremental improvements might be... &nbsp;<!-- -->[plus, in this case there's an existing product and customer base - so greatly evolving the game storage and socialization strategies might be disruptive]<!-- -->.</p><p>Instead - lets take this from a purely monetization perspective. &nbsp;One of the key focuses of brainCloud is not just providing the bread-and-butter of cloud tech - but also providing a platform that allows you to really increase the monetization of free-to-play games.</p><p>So - focusing just on the freemium monetization features - what minimal integration efforts would result in maximum return for the game?</p><p>The key features I'd suggest are:</p><ol><li><strong>IAP Validation</strong> - brainCloud provides server-side receipt validation, which eliminates IAP piracy, resulting in a boost to IAP sales. &nbsp;Let's be conservative and predict a <strong>5% boost</strong> to IAP revenue as a result. &nbsp;[For some background, see this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AaronIsaksen/20121213/183519/Piracy_Tracking_for_InApp_Purchases.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamaSutra article</a> regarding IAP piracy.]</li><li><strong>Scheduled Promotions</strong> - brainCloud provides certralized coordination of pricing and promotions, across platforms. &nbsp;And brainCloud supports scheduling of promotions - and automated sending of <strong>push notifications</strong> to inform the user base of the promotions as they happen. &nbsp;Sure this is stuff a product manager can coordinate manually - but when you're a small company, you tend to focus on the new products and leave the old ones to fend for themselves. &nbsp;It's fair to expect say <strong>2.5% boost</strong> from allowing brainCloud to do this for you.</li><li><strong>Automated <!-- -->[Targeted]<!-- --> Promotions</strong> - finally, brainCloud allows you to aim targeted promotions and dynamic player segments. &nbsp;This means, you can define a player segment for "VIPs that are leaving the game" - and hit them with a special promotion to get them to stay. &nbsp;Given that whales are responsible for 80% of revenue for most games, extending that stay should be easily worth another <strong>5% boost</strong>.</li></ol><p>It would only take a week or two to add these features to the game (plus a bit of testing of course).</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-math">The Math<a class="hash-link" href="#the-math" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The game is currently bringing in about $30K USD per month (50,000 DAU x 0.02 ARPDAU x 30 days). &nbsp;A 12.5% increase on the monetization results in an additional $3,750 USD per month.</p><p>But... &nbsp;now there are <!-- -->[brainCloud]<!-- --> server costs - so we've got to factor that in.</p><p>Looking closely at <a href="http://getbraincloud.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainCloud pricing</a>, you can see that 50K users is estimated at about $1600 USD per month - which seems pretty reasonable given the benefit.</p><p>But wait, that's assuming 100 brainCloud API calls per DAU - if the game is only using brainCloud for monetizaiton, it's API usage will be way, way down - we're probably talking 5-10 API calls per DAU (and that's assuming players are playing multiple sessions a day).</p><p>Lets say it's 10 API calls per DAU. &nbsp;In a month, that would be only 10 x 50,000 x 30 = 15M calls - which is actually only $150 / month<!-- -->*<!-- -->. &nbsp;Talk about a bargain! :)</p><p><em>*<!-- --> and that's before the early adopter discounts!</em></p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-results">The Results<a class="hash-link" href="#the-results" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>And, the moral of the story is, <em>there's always room for increased monetization</em>.</p><p>Our estimates are that for a cost of 10 days of integration, plus $150 monthly for brainCloud, the developer will see a 12.5% increase in sales, which in this case is a monthly increase of almost $3600 USD per month.</p><p>Even if the increase were over-estimated by a factor of 10x it would still be worth it in the long term...</p><p>Cool.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-final-note">One Final Note<a class="hash-link" href="#one-final-note" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This pricing analysis points out one of the greatest aspects of the brainCloud pricing model - you just pay for the amount of the service you use (in millions of API calls), not for the amount of the service that the provider fears you <!-- -->*<!-- -->might<!-- -->*<!-- --> use.</p><p><strong>Utilizing these same features from competing platforms at 50K DAU could cost as much as $3000 / month!</strong></p><p><em>Makes brainCloud seem like quite the deal, doesn't it? :)</em></p><p>[otw<!-- -->_<!-- -->shortcode<!-- -->_<!-- -->button href="https://portal.braincloudservers.com/signup" size="large" icon<!-- -->_<!-- -->position="left" shape="radius"]<!-- -->Sign Up For Free<!-- -->[/otw<!-- -->_<!-- -->shortcode<!-- -->_<!-- -->button]</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bitheads-announces-braincloud-a-new-revolutionary-cloud-solution-for-game-developers">bitHeads announces brainCloud, a new revolutionary cloud solution for game developers<a class="hash-link" href="#bitheads-announces-braincloud-a-new-revolutionary-cloud-solution-for-game-developers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><em>Leading games technology company today announced the industry-wide availability of brainCloud, a streamlined backend solution for comprehensive, cloud-based game management.</em></p><p>Ottawa, Ontario, and Montreal International Games Summit (MIGS), Nov 12, 2014 -- Previously only available to select game developers, bitHeads has officially launched brainCloud to support backend development and build revenue opportunities for game developers.</p><p>An out-of-the box solution for game development and management challenges, brainCloud is set to revolutionize the interactive games industry.brainCloud is a robust backend cloud-based production toolset that cuts game development time and costs by providing a one-stop solution that manages multiplayer features, monetization, cross-platform analytics, promotions, sales, and more. brainCloud works seamlessly with existing tools to operate and grow a game developers’ core business.</p><p>Dramatic shifts in mobile game development over the last five years demand fast-paced development that integrates innovative tools and drive user engagement while providing effective analytics and monetization strategies. To be commercially viable, games require multi-platform and multi-network support, game management systems, deployment, and advanced analytics. Addressing this need, brainCloud is an advanced solution within the emerging category of the cloud-based platform tools for games development.</p><p>Key brainCloud features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Game Features</strong> - multiplayer, matchmaking, cloud-saves, identity management, social integration, leaderboards, achievements, push notifications, virtual currencies, and in-app purchasing. Using the JavaScript-supported brainCloud Cloud Code feature, developers are able to build in additional features.</li><li><strong>Local Platform Integration</strong> - when a player is awarded an Achievement in brainCloud, that achievement is also triggered in iOS GameCenter.</li><li><strong>Advanced Pricing and Promotional Features</strong> - brainCloud provides support for multiple virtual currencies and coordinates the product and pricing management across all platforms, allowing the developer to quickly put items on sale with just a few clicks.</li><li><strong>Scheduled Promotions</strong> - sales can be pre-configured well into the future and when the promotion automatically triggers, players will receive notifications on their devices (in their language), and automatically get the preferential pricing when they go into their store screens.</li><li><strong>Advanced Auto Promotions</strong> - developers are able to define dynamic target segments of users and trigger individual promotions just for them. For example, a developer could define a promotion for “MVPs that may be leaving the game” - and define the criteria as “players who’ve played &gt; 50 times, who’ve spent &gt; $20, and who haven’t played in the past 5 days”. Whenever a player enters this segment, a special “Promotion for MVPs” would be triggered, offering them a product at a huge discount, in an attempt to keep them in the game longer.</li></ul><p>“Auto Promotions are just the beginning of the sort of advanced monetization features that bitHeads has in store for brainCloud,” notes brainCloud product manager Paul Winterhalder. “There’s no limit to the sort of advanced features that we can build to help developers to better engage and monetize their communities.”</p><p>"Having worked with the team at brainCloud on multiple projects, they definitely know their stuff when it comes highly-scalable back-ends,” says Stu Duncan, founder of Bight Games, the creators of 'The Simpsons: Tapped Out”.</p><p>“Before building our latest game, Project Cyber, we looked at a number of backend-as-a-service platforms. None of them had as complete a game feature set as brainCloud”, says Spearhead Games co-founder Atul Mehra.</p><p>Wanda Meloni, CEO of M2 Research explains, "Solutions such as brainCloud now offer small-to-mid-size developers the sort of back-end infrastructure previously only available to larger developers such as Zynga, King.com and Supercell. Providing an out-of-the-box solution, bitHeads and brainCloud are really leveling the playing field."</p><p>Outlining key findings from M2 Research’s upcoming State of Game Development Report Meloni notes, “Independent developers with less than 25 employees now make up 62% of the games development market, while mid to large scale indies represent another 13%. With 75% of the total game development market made up of independent teams, optimizing backend infrastructure is critical for developers looking to build in cross-platform development, monetization and ultimately cost savings."</p><p>"bitHeads has been building customized backend solutions for clients since 1995. The growth and need in the market is there, and with brainCloud we have built a robust and scalable platform that helps developers concentrate on what they do best - make great games. We help them get games out faster, save on development, hosting and maintenance costs, and have built-in features specifically created to increase revenue," says Scott Simpson, CEO of bitHeads.</p><p>Developers who sign up before December 31, 2014 qualify for special early adopter pricing until 2016.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gameplay-is-not-enough">Gameplay is not enough<a class="hash-link" href="#gameplay-is-not-enough" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Game companies can no longer focus <em>solely</em> on designing fun - today’s studios are adapting the free-to-play business model and with it the increased focus on accessibility, monetization, conversion rates, social acquisition, and constant evolution.</p><p>With the new models and platforms of today, large developers are increasingly building and integrating cloud services into their games, to better tap into and maximize the Free-to-Play business model.</p><p>Given the essential nature of these systems, it is no wonder that many companies choose to implement their own back-end. In fact, as of August 2014, 49 of the top 50 Top Grossing iOS games were all utilizing custom backend solutions that cost millions of dollars to build.</p><p>Which is fine if you are a top tier developer who’s already had your big hit in the market. <em>But what if you’re not?</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-better-way">A better way<a class="hash-link" href="#a-better-way" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Over the years, we at brainCloud have built our fair share of these back-ends — for everything from online casinos and arena shooters, to top-tier mobile games like Simpsons: Tapped Out.</p><p>We know from experience that there is a ton of common features in all of these back-ends, and that every <em>custom</em> solution ends up having game-specific logic and often <em>significant</em> compromises in it’s implementation. (And, without exception, extreme gaps in their tools support).</p><p>We realized that there had to be a better way. A way to design a system that could be used out-of-the-box by a huge variety of game types, customized where necessary, and deployed in a rapid fashion to support the tight development schedules and budgets of today’s gaming market.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="presenting-braincloud---a-backend-for-gaming">Presenting brainCloud - a Backend for Gaming<a class="hash-link" href="#presenting-braincloud---a-backend-for-gaming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a target="_blank" href="/braincloud-apiref/assets/files/braincloud_a_backend_platforms-c3e34a5a5d10f32b6c47490ed558d2ab.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="braincloud_a_backend_platforms" src="/braincloud-apiref/assets/images/braincloud_a_backend_platforms-c3e34a5a5d10f32b6c47490ed558d2ab.png" width="300" height="634" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>And so, we’re pleased to present brainCloud - the result of three years of development, countless years of experience in the industry, and all our best thinking. We call it a “Backend in a Box” - and it’s so much more than the competing solutions out there.</p><p>We start with all the key gaming features you <strong>need</strong> —<em>multiplayer</em>, <em>matchmaking</em>, <em>cloud data</em>, <em>leaderboards</em>,<em>achievements</em>, <em>identity management</em>, <em>social integration</em>, <em>in-app purchase support</em>, <em>push notifications</em> — we’ve got you covered.</p><p>Add the confidence of knowing that if there’s something that we don’t yet do - you can implement it yourself using our <strong>Cloud Code</strong> feature (server-based scripting in JavaScript).</p><p>To keep you productive, we provide <strong>native libraries</strong> for all the major platforms and game engines (Unity, Cocos2d-x, Unreal) - so you won’t mucking about making your own http/rest calls (unless you want to).</p><p>And we’ve paired those libraries up with the most <strong>feature-rich tools</strong> in the business - that support your entire team through the <em>design</em>, <em>development</em>, <em>testing+support</em> and<em>product management</em> cycles of your product.</p><p>And finally, the best for last - we’ve built upon this platform a set of advanced <strong>Promotions</strong> features that enable you to identify and target key segments of your player base and engaged them in individualized promotions - providing you the means to increase conversion, retention, and engagement - igniting your game’s monetization to new levels.</p><p>I look forward to taking a deeper dive into brainCloud with you in the coming weeks - stay tuned - and happy coding!</p><p>For more information <a href="http://hub.getbraincloud.com/backend-as-a-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download our datasheet</a>, or better yet...</p><p>[otw<!-- -->_<!-- -->shortcode<!-- -->_<!-- -->button href="https://portal.braincloudservers.com/signup" size="large" icon<!-- -->_<!-- -->position="centre" shape="radius"]<!-- -->Sign Up For Free<!-- -->[/otw<!-- -->_<!-- -->shortcode<!-- -->_<!-- -->button]</p>]]></content:encoded>
