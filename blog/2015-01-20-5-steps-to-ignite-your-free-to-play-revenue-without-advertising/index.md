## 5 Steps to Ignite your Free-to-Play Revenue (without Advertising)

**Only one in ten mobile games succeed**.

The business reality is that since 2011, [Free-to-Play (F2P) games have been making more money than their Premium counterparts](http://www.flurry.com/bid/65656/Free-to-play-Revenue-Overtakes-Premium-Revenue-in-the-App-Store#.VL1T5calP5t).

Although still essential - _today's games must be more than j__ust fun -_ they must effectively employ [**F2P monetization**](http://hub.getbraincloud.com/monetization) to succeed.

[![bc-5steps-succedss](images/bc-5steps-succedss.png)](images/bc-5steps-succedss.png)An effective [Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)](http://hub.getbraincloud.com/richfeatureset) is an essential lubricant for the free-to-play economy. Here are 5 key ways a great Backend can ignite your free-to-play revenue:

1. **Go Cross-Platform** - adding platforms adds audience, which feeds players into your F2P engine. An effective Back-end makes it easier to offer the same features across diverse platforms.
2. **Enable Cross-play** - allowing your players to continue their play across devices encourages play when and where convenient, increasing engagement and forming habits
3. **Add social competition** - social competition is an excellent way to give players additional objectives in your game, increasing engagement (and virality)
4. **Reduce cheating + theft** - utilize server-side receipt validation to remove in-app piracy and increase your revenues.
5. **Grow/Retain your VIPs** -  utilize an automated promotions engine to help push players through your funnel, and retain the VIPs that you have (increasing $ spend)
