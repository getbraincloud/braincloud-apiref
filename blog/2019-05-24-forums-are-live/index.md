By popular demand, we are pleased to announce that our new [forums](https://forums.getbraincloud.com) are live!

There are 3 ways to get there:

- Choose **Visit brainCloud Forums** on the **Team | Start Page** of the Portal
- Choose **Forums** from the **DOCS** menu at the top of the Portal
- Enter [forums.getbraincloud.com](https://forums.getbraincloud.com) into your browser

Once you are there, click **Login** in the _top right corner_ - it uses your regular brainCloud login.

Come on over and introduce yourself! The forums are far too clean and tidy right now - lets mess things up!
