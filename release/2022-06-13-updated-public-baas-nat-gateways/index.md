Our DevOps team had to update brainCloud set of NAT gateways for brainCloud's Public BaaS (i.e. portal.braincloudservers.com). This only affects developers who have whitelisted these IPs for security purposes.

The updated list of outgoing IPs is:

- 204.236.224.149
- 34.233.118.83
- 54.152.153.10
- 44.206.200.165

Apologies for the short notice and inconvenience.
