brainCloud 4.13 has just dropped. Here’s what it contains…

:::caution

Note - the implementation of `GlobalEntity.IncrementGlobalEntityData()` and `Entity.IncrementUserEntityData()` have changed - to properly enforce `acl.other` permissions. Be sure that your app isn’t improperly using those methods against entities with `acl.other` set to `0` or `1` - because those calls will now fail under 4.13!  
  
Also creating unowned Group Entities via `Group.CreateGroupEntity()` or `Group.SysCreateGroupEntity()` with `acl.member` of `0` or `1` will no longer be overridden to `2` permission.  
  
_Contact support if you would like our team to reset any previously created entities for you._

### App Minimum Password Standards

This feature allows developers to set minimum password requirements for the users of their apps.

The following requirements can be set:

- minLength - <x\> chars. Default 8
- maxLength - <y\> chars. Default is 25 (max is 128).
- minDigits - <n\>. Default 1
- minUppercase - <n\>. Default 1
- minLowercase - <n\>. Default 1
- minSymbols - <n\>. Default 1

Feature notes:

- This feature affects users when setting _new_ passwords. _Existing_ passwords already associated with an account are _not_ affected by this feature.
- For symbol enforcement, the following characters are treated as symbols: ``~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|(){}[]:;'<>,.?/``

If enabled, these standards are automatically enforced by brainCloud when:

- **creating** new accounts
    - using Email or Universal authentication
    - using following User service APIs (if a password is provided – generated passwords will not be verified):
        - SysCreateUserEmailPassword
        - SysCreateUserUniversalId
- **attaching** new Email or Universal identities
- **updating** passwords (via **reset** password and other mechanisms)

Attempting to create an account (or attach an identity) whose password does not meet the requirements will return the new `INVALID_PASSWORD_CONTENT` ( `550022`) reason code.

```
{
  "status_message": "Processing exception (message): Password should have minimum 1 uppercase character/s",
  "reason_code": 550022
}
```

### **Temporary Leaderboards**

Apps can now more easily create temporary leaderboards using the `SysCreateLeaderboardConfig()` call. A new field, `expireInMins`, has been added to the configuration object to control the lifetime of the leaderboard. Leaderboards set to expire will show an epoch timestamp the expiry field returned from `SysGetLeaderboardConfig()` and other methods. The system will automatically remove the leaderboard after the specified time has expired.

_Technically the clean-up is done nightly, but those are just implementation details._

This provides a convenient method for creating temporary leaderboards, without having to implement a separate process to clean them up.

_Note that this functionality is limited to ADHOC and NEVER rotation leaderboards (i.e. leaderboards that don’t rotate)._

### Resend Verification Emails

For apps with **Reject Unverified Email Logins** enabled (via the **Design | Authentication | Email** screen) -- the system will now **automatically resend** the verification email to users when they re-attempt to login.

### GameLift-based Relay Servers

We have extended our AWS GameLift integration to include support for Relay Servers.

For instructions on how to configure them, see this [article](https://help.getbraincloud.com/en/articles/5606739-using-braincloud-lobbies-with-your-gamelift-servers).

### Non-consumable IAP Product History

Non-consumable In-App-Purchases can be processed multiple times (unless the “_Do not reprocess currencies for non-consumable IAP products in receipts_” compatibility flag is enabled).

This can be triggered when an iOS user clicks [Restore Purchases] on an app. Doing so may cause the transaction to be moved from one brainCloud account to another… (for example - if the iOS user is using a different brainCloud account than when they originally made the purchase).

_Note that this sort of activity could also theoretically happen if your app has been cracked and users are sending stolen (but valid) receipts into brainCloud._

We have enhanced the system to keep track of all users that have processed a non-consumable IAP item. The processing history can be viewed by clicking on the new **View History** menu option on the **Monitoring | User Monitoring | Transactions** screen.

### Library Improvements

All client libraries have been updated to include the 4.13 API additions.

_Note that some of the listed improvements were included in 4.12 patches previously._

- **C++**
    - Upgraded WebSockets for RTT with embedded SSL certification
    - Reconnect() method returns a failure if previous connection information is not available
    - Improved build time in Objective-C
    - Improvements for Android Studio builds
    - Added response codes and API calls
- **Java**
    - Added 502 & 504 response code conditions to retry requests.
    - `Reconnect()` method returns a failure if previous connection information is not available
- **Javascript**
    - `Reconnect()` method returns a failure if previous connection information is not available
- **Unity**
    - Compressed Responses and Requests are now turned on by default. This should be transparent to your app - but can be disabled by setting `EnabledCompressedRequests(false)` and `EnableCompressedResponses(false)`.
    - `Reconnect()` method returns a failure if previous connection information is not available
    - Adding Mac OS support for getting country code while initializing the client
    - Now supports Unity up to 2021.3 LTS
- **Unreal lib**
    - Plugin supports and ready to use in **Unreal Engine 5**
    - Fixes to engine heartbeat not working as intended (also in 4.12.2 patch)
    - Reconnect() method returns a failure if previous connection information is not available
    - Moved plugin to standalone release in GitHub for use as git submodule (Improved setup in GitHub?)
    - Fixed MacOS build error
    - Added check for failed connection callback

### Miscellaneous Improvements

- **ACL Permissions** **fixes**
    - Fixes have been applied to several methods in Global, User and Group Entities.
    - Be sure to double-check the ACL permissions of you entity objects if you see issues with your app(s)
- **Custom Entity** **improvements**
    - New `IncrementSingletonData()` API call
    - Improved locking for **Custom Entity Singletons**
- **Deployment** **improvements**
    - Improvements to the web and server components to prevent parallel deployment / import / restore processes
    - Optimizations to cache notifications to reduce the traffic across the api servers
    - Added a fail-safe refresh after deployment to ensure that all caches are updated properly
- **Dormant User** **processing**
    - Refactored dormant user deletion to add parallel processing (across datastream servers)
- **Global Files**
    - Fixes to file versioning during deploys and imports (was also patched late in 4.12)
    - New portal function to manually edit a File’s version on the **Design | Custom Config | Global Files** page
- **Groups**
    - The _custom data_ section of **Group** objects are now indexed on an `indexedId` field (if it exists). Feel free to set that field, and do searches using it for quick lookups of groups via an alternate id.
- **Legacy Flagged Users API**
    - We’ve added an API for controlling the users that that appear in the Portal’s flagged users list.
    - This is legacy system, and not super-scaleable - and thus we have named the methods as such.
    - Important: Apps are limited to 1000 flagged users max.
    - The API methods can be found in the **GlobalApp** service. ← due to the legacy of it’s implementation
    - _Do NOT use these APIs for anything other than tagging users to make them easier to look-up in the portal._
- **Push Notifications**
    - Improvements to performance of **Push Notifications** sent to **all** users of an app
- **S2S API**
    - Significant improvements to **S2S** locking - prevents lock timeouts in certain situations
- **Steam** **integration improvements**
    - Steam purchase transaction ids are now prefixed by the appId of the brainCloud app processing them. This reduces situations where the ids may clash if the same Steam information is being used across both dev and production apps in brainCloud.
    - System now returns more useful information for failed SteamClient validations

### Features for Private Licensees

- **Portal SSO**
    - Improvements to handling of mixed-case email addresses for SSO-connected private deployments
- **Azure**
    - Improvements to handling of long-lived Azure ServiceBus requests

## Portal Changes

We've made the following portal changes:

### Design Section

- **Authentication | Passwords**
    - New Passwords screen allows apps to enforce minimum password standards

![](images/2022-10-18_16-00-36.png)

- **Cloud Code | API Hooks**
    - Hooks are properly ordered by **Service**, then **Operation** in the main screen
    - Also, when selecting a script for a hook, the scrips are now sorted alphabetically by path
- **Cloud Code | Scripts**
    - Quick Authenticate now ensures it chooses a platform that is enabled
    - Optimizations to the script editor - no longer retrieves _all_ scripts when attempting to run the current script!
- **Custom Config | Global Files**
    - You can now manually adjust the “version” of a file using by choosing **Adjust Version** from the Action menu.
- I**ntegrations | Blockchain**
    - Added new Ultra App blockchain integration to be used by Ultra licensee apps to enable integration with Ultra’s blockchain services - including Uniqs.

### Monitoring

- **Global Monitoring | Custom Entities**
    - Custom Entity collections now displayed in alphabetical order
- **User Monitoring | Transactions**
    - The processing history of a non-consumable transaction can now be viewed by choosing the **View History** option from the action menu. Note that the **View History** menu option will only be available for transactions that have history to view.

* * *

## API Changes

The following changes/additions have affected the brainCloud API:

- **Blockchain**
    - New `GetUniqs()` call added for retrieving Uniqs from the **Ultra** blockchain
    - Also new `GetBlockchainItems()` for other blockchain flavors
- **Bridge**
    - New `VerifySignedJwt()` method added to the cloud code bridge to aid in implementing OpenId via External Authentication
    - Added `GetSessionForValidatedCredential()` method to the client bridge... (was only in the server bridge before)
- **Custom Entity Service**
    - New `IncrementSingletonData()` API call
- **GlobalApp**
    - New methods for controlling the users that appear in the Portal’s flagged users list. This is legacy system, and not super-scaleable - and thus we have named the methods as such. _Do NOT use these APIs for anything other than tagging users to make them easier to look-up in the portal._
    - Important: Apps are limited to 1000 flagged users max.
    - The new methods are: `SysAddLegacyFlaggedUser()`, `SysGetLegacyFlaggedUserData()`, `SysGetLegacyFlaggedUserDataList()`, `SysRemoveFromLegacyFlaggedUsers()`, `SysUpdateLegacyFlaggedUser()`
- **Group Service**
    - New cloud code only `SysAddGroupMember()` call adds the specified member to the group immediately (irregardless of the permissions of the current user)
- **Leaderboard Service**
    - `SysCreateLeaderboardConfig()` and `SysEditLeaderboardConfig()` methods updated to access the new `expireInMins` field. Select methods like `SysGetLeaderboardConfig()` now return an `expiry` field with the calculated epoch expiry.
- **RTT**
    - New `RegisterBlockchainCallback()` and `DeregisterBlockchainCallback()` methods enable registering for real-time blockchain changes
- **Script Service**
    - Added new cloud code only `SysCancelScheduledScriptIfExists()` call which as the name implies, cancels a script if it exists - but more importantly, does not return an error if it does not!
    - Added new cloud code only `SysCancelUserScriptBatchIfExists()` to do the same for batch script processing
