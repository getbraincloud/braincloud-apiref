# Email Authentication

brainCloudâ€™s email authentication service allows end-users to identify themselves with their email address and a unique password for the app. Developers may optionally decide to validate these email addresses via our Email Authentication service (which involves sending an email to the user with an URL that the user must click on to validate).
