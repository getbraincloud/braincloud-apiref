bar examples:

:::caution this is a caution

Some popular languages like Java, C#, or PHP are not enabled by default.

:::

:::note this is a note

Each additional language has to be a valid Prism component name. For example, Prism would map the _language_ `cs` to `csharp`, but only `prism-csharp.js` exists as a _component_, so you need to use `additionalLanguages: ['csharp']`. You can look into `node_modules/prismjs/components` to find all components (languages) available.
