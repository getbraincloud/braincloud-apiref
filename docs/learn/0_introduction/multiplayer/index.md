## Mobile Multiplayer

brainCloud provides _built-in_ support for mobile-friendly, non-realtime multiplayer.

Full APIs for the following multiplayer types are provided:

- **Turn-by-Turn Async** - made popular by games like Words with Friends, Draw Something, etc.
- **One-way Offline** - made popular by games like Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, etc.

brainCloud also provides customizable _offline matchmaking_ support (perfect for the above multiplayer options).

## Online Multiplayer via RTT

brainCloud RTT adds support for _Online Matchmaking_ and _Lobbies,_ and the development of custom _Room Experiences_ to meet the needs for today's most competitive online experiences.

## Third Party Multiplayer

Finally, brainCloud famously plays nicely with third-party real-time multiplayer SDKs, such as Photon, Unity, Steam, Unreal and more.
