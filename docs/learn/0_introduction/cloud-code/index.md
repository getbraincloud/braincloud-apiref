_If brainCloud doesn't support a feature you need? Write it!_

brainCloud allows developers to write custom code in JavaScript, and call it from a client, another server, or trigger it automatically as a pre-condition or post-condition of a standard brainCloud API call.

More information on Cloud Code is available [here](/apidocs/apiref/#cc).
