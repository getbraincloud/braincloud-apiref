That said, we want to assure all GameSparks customers and partners that brainCloud can offer all developers (from hobbyists, startups, and big studios alike) an alternative to ensure efficient and full migration to prevent downtime for their players.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most of you know, we launched brainCloud in **2014** and have been supporting all kinds of indies and big studios since then. We\u2019ve also recently been working as a solution integrator in collaboration with Amazon Game Tech to assist\xa0GameSparks deprecation efforts and existing GameSparks customer migration.\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud has a robust, comparable feature set that includes popular GameSparks features like Player and Game Management, Cloud Scripts, Leaderboards, Achievements, Messaging, Virtual Goods & Currencies, and Real-time features like Lobbies, Matchmaking, Notifications, and Chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, brainCloud also has advanced features not implemented in GameSparks like Custom Room & Relay Servers for real-time multiplayer, Tournaments, Blockchain Integration, Segments, Profanity Filters, Pricing and Promotion features, Playback Streams and connectivity to virtually any data collection or storage application through our Datastream service.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course, brainCloud supports all popular mobile and console platforms, including built-in Oculus support. We even have APIs to help migrate your users over to our back-end. And of particular interest to ex-GameSparks folks, we are happy to announce that _**Amazon GameLift integration will be added to brainCloud this fall!**_\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this is available via a variety of licensing options that range from monthly BaaS subscriptions all the way up to private and platform licensing. All with world-class support and available professional services.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe encourage all existing GameSparks customers to check out brainCloud and let us know how we can help you migrate and grow your games on all platforms. We are here to help. Just sign up - brainCloud is free during development!\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Coding,\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul from brainCloud.  \\r\\n( _PS - For more information, check out our [GameSparks Migration FAQ](http://help.getbraincloud.com/en/articles/5441729-gamesparks-migration-faq)._ )"},{"id":"/2021/03/11/apple-ios-14-5-privacy-facebook-limited-login-mode","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2021/03/11/apple-ios-14-5-privacy-facebook-limited-login-mode","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2021-03-11-apple-ios-14-5-privacy-facebook-limited-login-mode/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-11-apple-ios-14-5-privacy-facebook-limited-login-mode/index.md","title":"Apple iOS 14.5 Privacy & Facebook Limited Login\xa0mode","description":"Apple is introducing comprehensive changes to iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and tvOS 14.5 that will require apps to\xa0ask users for their permission\xa0to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.","date":"2021-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 11, 2021","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":2.99,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"},{"name":"Jason Liang","title":"software develop & technical specialist","url":"https://github.com/JasonZhLiang","imageURL":"https://github.com/JasonZhLiang.png","key":"jason"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Apple iOS 14.5 Privacy & Facebook Limited Login\xa0mode","date":"2021-03-11","authors":["paul","jason"],"tags":["blog"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Migrating from GameSparks","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2021/07/22/migrating-from-gamesparks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Warning: Unity 2019.X (iOS) issues","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2019/06/17/warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues"}},"content":"Apple is introducing comprehensive changes to iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and tvOS 14.5 that will require apps to\xa0[ask users for their permission](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/)\xa0to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first glance, this seems like something that would mostly affect apps that are using user data for advertising-based monetization\u200a\u2014\u200abut in truth, the implications are deeper than that.\\r\\n\\r\\n_For the record, we at\xa0[*brainCloud*](https://getbraincloud.com/) -- very much appreciate and advocate for user privacy. All user data associated with a brainCloud app is private to that app\u200a\u2014\u200athe data is not aggregated or shared across apps or companies in any way. So if your app is using brainCloud without 3rd party authentication, you can feel confident that that data is not being shared in any way._\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, brainCloud does support authentication-based integrations with third party providers\u200a\u2014\u200amost importantly Facebook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frequently Asked Questions from the [Apple page linked above](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) clarify their guidance in this area:\\r\\n\\r\\n![](images/facebookL1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this interpretation, just offering a classic Facebook Account login for your app\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is prety standard practice\u200a\u2014\u200arequires you to get the user\u2019s permission for tracking across apps and websites owned by other companies. The rationale is that your app may not be sharing the data\u200a\u2014\u200abut Facebook itself certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from Facebook\u2019s objections to these changes (we don\u2019t want to get into that)\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook has offered a recommended technical solution\u200a\u2014\u200athey have extended their Facebook Login feature to include a new [Limited Login Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/).\\r\\n\\r\\n![](images/facebookL.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo\u200a\u2014\u200aLimited Login mode seems like a pretty good solution to this problem. There is a pretty big limitation here though.\xa0**_If users opt for the Limited Login mode, the app will not have access to the Graph API_**.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor games and social apps\u200a\u2014\u200athis is a pretty big limitation. It means that the app (and backend services like brainCloud that act on it\u2019s behalf) will\xa0**_lose the ability to query Facebook for the user\u2019s friends_**. This will have a huge impact on games that depend upon those sorts of social interactions for engagement and monetization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is therefore highly recommended that games pop-up their own informational message before Apple\u2019s built-in pop-up, to educate the user on any features that may become unavailable as a consequence of their choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother issue is that the identification information returned from the new Limited Login mode is different than with the Classic Login. This means that\xa0_backend services, like brainCloud, need to implement changes to work with this new mode_. The silver lining is that the underlying id of the user remains the same between the two modes\u200a\u2014\u200aso a user who flips back and forth between the two modes can still be associated with the same back-end account\u200a\u2014\u200aphew!\\r\\n\\r\\n**_We at brainCloud are working hard to incorporate the necessary changes\u200a\u2014\u200aand will be releasing brainCloud 4.7 with Facebook Limited Login mode before the end of March 2021._**\\r\\n\\r\\nA few more details about the changes in brainCloud 4.7:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Full Support for\xa0_Facebook Limited Login_\xa0mode across the authentication + identity APIs. The same user using either mode will be linked to the same underlying brainCloud profile.\\r\\n- brainCloud will automatically handle the loss of the Graph API for Limited Login mode users\u200a\u2014\u200aso for example, users will simply appear to have no Facebook friends (instead of the client app having to deal with errors).\\r\\n- Coincidentally, brainCloud 4.7 will include new support for Steam and Playstation Network friends\u200a\u2014\u200aso apps can extend their friend support in other areas.\\r\\n- brainCloud already supports self-managed\xa0[Friend APIs](http://getbraincloud.com/api/capi/friend). See AddFriends(), ListFriends(), etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope that this helps to clarify the impact of these changs to iOS 14.5, and how brainCloud can help your apps to adapt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Coding!"},{"id":"/2019/06/17/warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2019/06/17/warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2019-06-17-warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-06-17-warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues/index.md","title":"Warning: Unity 2019.X (iOS) issues","description":"Update - this issue was addressed in Unity 2019.3.

All good now!\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nHi folks,\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are currently tracking some oddities in the reliability of the brainCloud libraries running in **Unity 2019.X** on **iOS devices**.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Updates_:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **We have confirmed that this issue is limited to iOS only** (edit: also probably tvOS). It does not occur on Android, Mac, Windows or WebGL.\\r\\n2. **A Unity Rep has confirmed the defect, and that they are working on a fix**. See this [Unity Forum thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/ios-post-request-with-raw-data.690514/).\\r\\n3. The defect now appears in Unity\'s Issue Tracker - click and add your +1 - https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unitywebrequest-errors-large-packets-with-examples\\r\\n4. Further updates in this [brainCloud Forum Post](https://forums.getbraincloud.com/topic/25/important-unity-2019-x-on-mobile-devices).\\r\\n\\r\\n**_Executive Summary: We highly advise developers to stick with Unity 2018.X until further notice._**\\r\\n\\r\\n## Symptoms\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symptom is that requests are being sent to brainCloud, and occasionally rejected with what brainCloud calls a **_signature error_**.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature errors are flagged if the content of the message that brainCloud receives doesn\'t match the MD5 that has been calculated for the message. They generally mean that either the client had the wrong secret (likely a hacking attempt) or the message content has been tampered with (also likely a man-in-the-middle hacking attempt).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case, neither of these has occurred - rather, the message content has been corrupted somehow by Unity\'s libraries (we suspect a combination of the `UnityWebRequest` and/or `UploadHandler` classes).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn\'t happen all-the-time... (in fact, it very rarely occurs if requests are less than 2K). But we\'re seeing it happening quite often with requests that are **7K or greater in size**.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter enough of these errors occur, the `UnityWebRequest` class is locking up - causing the brainCloud client library to stop functioning properly - requiring the app to be terminated.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note - the good news is that brainCloud\'s servers catch this issue and prevent the bad message from corrupting your data. The bad news is that a client experiencing this issue might have to retry several times to send a request - impairing client performance._\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reproducing the error\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have only been able to reproduce this error in **Unity 2019.1.X** _(as well as 2019.2.0b5 (alpha) and 2019.3.0a5 (beta))_ and only when running on iOS devices.\\r\\n\\r\\n_We do have reason to suspect that Android devices may also be impacted (but we haven\'t had time to test + prove that yet). **Update: We have since tested on Android and cannot reproduce the problem. So this appears to be an iOS-only issue.**_\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, the same code running from the editor on Mac and Windows workstations seems to run just fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd certainly, the same brainCloud libraries (with test code) running under Unity 2018.X runs fine as well. _Also, our C++/Objective-C libraries are still running_ _fine_ _under iOS - this issue is limited to Unity._\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have noted, as per their 2019 release notes, that Unity seems to be making significant changes to their iOS communications.\\r\\n\\r\\n- 2019.1 Release notes\\r\\n    - iOS: UnityWebRequest will use new backend based on NSURLSession. Old NSUrlConnection backed is still available (commented out in trampoline)\\r\\n- 2019.1.4 Release notes:\\r\\n    - iOS: Fixed larger than 2k payloads not sent by UnityWebRequest when HTTP/2 (1146305, 1152777)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Recommendation\\r\\n\\r\\n**_For now, we recommend that developers limit their production iOS builds to Unity 2018.X or earlier._**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are constructing a limited function test app that we will submit to Unity when we report this defect. We will keep the community posted as to how that progresses.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Update - you can see the_ **_brainCloud forum post_**_, with repro code and details,_ [_here_](https://forums.getbraincloud.com/topic/25/important-unity-2019-x-on-mobile-devices/2)_._\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, we thought it best that our community have a heads up regarding this potential problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe apologize for the inconvenience and hope that through working with Unity, we can get a solution to you ASAP!"},{"id":"/2019/05/24/forums-are-live","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2019/05/24/forums-are-live","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2019-05-24-forums-are-live/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-24-forums-are-live/index.md","title":"Forums are live!","description":"By popular demand, we are pleased to announce that our new forums are live!","date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2019","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":0.47,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Forums are live!","date":"2019-05-24","authors":"paul","tags":["blog"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Warning: Unity 2019.X (iOS) issues","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2019/06/17/warning-unity-2019-x-ios-issues"},"nextItem":{"title":"V4 is coming!","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2019/05/22/v4-is-coming"}},"content":"![](images/braincloud-forum-logo-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBy popular demand, we are pleased to announce that our new [forums](https://forums.getbraincloud.com) are live!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 3 ways to get there:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Choose **Visit brainCloud Forums** on the **Team | Start Page** of the Portal\\r\\n- Choose **Forums** from the **DOCS** menu at the top of the Portal\\r\\n- Enter [forums.getbraincloud.com](https://forums.getbraincloud.com) into your browser\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you are there, click **Login** in the _top right corner_ - it uses your regular brainCloud login.\\r\\n\\r\\nCome on over and introduce yourself!

Limited to 100 DAU, 1000 accounts. Includes 10 CCx.\\r\\n- **Development Plus! ($5 /month)** - All features, **including hosting**. Limited to 200 DAU, 2000 accounts. Includes 20 CCx.\\r\\n- **Lite ($15 /month)** - Core features. Includes 1M API.\\r\\n- **Lite Plus ($25 /month)** - Core features + **RTT** + **Hosting**. Includes 1M API, 50 CCx.\\r\\n- **Standard ($30 /month)** - Core features. Includes 6M API.\\r\\n- **Standard Plus ($50 /month)** - Core features + **RTT** + **Hosting**. Includes 6M API, 100 CCx.\\r\\n- **Business ($99 /month)** - Core + **Enterprise** features. Includes 10M API.\\r\\n- **Business Plus ($199 /month)** - **All features**. Includes 15M API, 250 CCx.  \\r\\n    We are confident that we have a plan to fit every app!\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were putting together our new set of plans, we decided to simplify and standardize the API Usage Tier Pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll V4 plans use the _same_ discounting tiers as they scale (it used to differ by plan). So no matter what plan you start with, as you get to 15M total API calls for the month, the cost per M drops to $10.00.\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/APICallsTable4.png)](images/APICallsTable4.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne side effect of this standardization is that the cost of additional usage for **Business Plan** customers now starts at $10.25 / M API, instead of $10.00 / M API from the old plan. To make up for this, we have bumped up the **Business Plan** to include **10M API** for free (instead of 9M) - so it is a net win.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also made our API Usage pricing tiers more aggressive. In the old plans, you needed to hit 300M+ API calls to get to $9.90 / M pricing. _In the new plans, we drop the price to $9.75 / M API at just 25M+ API calls._\\r\\n\\r\\n**_We have accelerated the API discounting across the board, resulting in savings of 5-10% at high usage levels._**\\r\\n\\r\\n## New Plus Plans\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new **Plus** plans make **RTT** and **Hosting** features available to apps at all usage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures available to Plus plans include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Async Match with RTT\\r\\n- Chat\\r\\n- Lobbies\\r\\n- Online Matchmaking\\r\\n- Presence\\r\\n- Real-time Events\\r\\n- Real-time Messaging\\r\\n- Relay Server Hosting\\r\\n- Room Server Hosting\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd more!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have worked hard to keep the incremental costs of the Plus plans low - so that as many developers as possible can integrate these great new features into their apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note - Plus plans are subject to RTT Usage and Hosting Usage costs. More details in the sections that follow._\\r\\n\\r\\n## New Lite Plans\\r\\n\\r\\nA frequent request has been for lower-cost, lower-usage plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are pleased to present our new **Lite** and **Lite Plus** plans. These plans offer the _all the same features_ as their **Standard** plan equivalents, but at lower 1M API usage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese plans, which start at just $15 and $25 /month respectively, are great for indie developers, the development of smaller experimental apps, and even for more ambitious apps in the long-tail phase of their product lifecycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n## RTT Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud\'s RTT features require a nailed-up TCP or WebSocket connection for every client device. The costs to brainCloud are in **maintaining connections (CCx)** from our servers, and **delivering** the millions of real-time events to your users as they participate in chat, messaging, lobbies, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo account for this utilization, we simply convert these resources to API counts.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery RTT plan comes with a number of **Concurrent Connections** (**CCx**) that are **free** _per hour_. For example, the Standard Plus plan includes 100 CCx. That means that a peak of 100 Users can be _concurrently_ online without additional CCx usage fees. Assuming your average play session is 12 minutes, that might actually equate to 500 users per hour, or 12K users per day. And that\'s if RTT is enabled for the full time that users are in your app. _Optimize your app to only initialize RTT when you need it, and 100 CCx could equate to thousands of users per hour._\\r\\n\\r\\nAbove that, apps are charged at a rate of 10 API calls per CCx per hour. So - lets say your app was averaging double that - or 200 CCx. The additional costs would be 100 x 10 API/CCx x 24 hours x 30 days = 720,000 API counts. At ~ $10 / M API, that\'s about $7.20 in usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other component of RTT Usage is **event delivery**. RTT is great for chat and lobby operations - where one operation may fan out to dozens (or thousands) of recipients. That\'s great functionality wise - but those deliveries can really add up!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news is that RTT is very efficient at delivering events - so we are charging at a bulk ratio of 100:1 - that is, your app is charged just **1 API count for each 100 events** delivered!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Hosting Usage\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud now supports hosting of _Relay Servers_ and custom _Room Servers_. This really opens up the sort of experiences that can be accommodated in a pure brainCloud environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news is that you aren\'t charged for API calls / messaging / etc to your hosted servers -- even if the server is one of our Relay Servers (using our new Relay Protocol).\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, we do of course need to pass along the cloud costs of hosting the servers, and the data transfer usage associated with it, from the cloud provider.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor pricing, brainCloud is simply marking up the hosting costs by 15%, and adding 1.5 cents per hour for managing the servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help keep costs low, brainCloud will automatically spin up / down servers as required. There are a complete set of parameters that can be customized to allow Teams to fine tune the best balance between server cost and performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n## And those are the new plans!\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the billing changes for v 4.0.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe appreciate that brainCloud\'s adherence to elastic pricing can seem a bit complicated. It is certainly more complicated than traditional per-MAU pricing. But in the great majority of cases, it is also much better value.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur overall goal when designing our pricing models is to ensure that the pricing you are charged reflects the costs that we incur in providing the service.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe feel this approach aligns our interests. The more server resources your apps consume, the higher our costs, and the higher the price to you. But the more efficiently you can build your app, the lower our costs, and the lower the pricing for you. It\'s win:win - and we are on the same side!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us via the Green Chat widget.

It does this by:\\r\\n\\r\\n- providing local implementation of brainCloud client calls (instead of forcing the client app to use Raw REST calls)\\r\\n- automating communications with the server (bundling of messages for efficiency, packet security, and more)\\r\\n- performing standard error handling\\r\\n\\r\\nThe library is actually organized into two major components:\\r\\n\\r\\n- the brainCloud Client Library - a pure, platform-independent wrapper of the brainCloud client-server protocol\\r\\n- the brainCloud Wrapper - simplifies aspects of the API (especially authentication) by incorporating more client-side functionality, like saving and restoring anonymousIds and profileIds.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of the client library is required by apps. Use of the wrapper is highly recommended, but optional.\xa0_Note - originally we only had the client library. The wrapper was added later as an aid to app developers._ \\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nDelving deeper into the design, you can see that the client object maintains a list of services and internal components that work together to provide the client functionality. The wrapper on the other hand is quite simple, and merely adds an additional simplification layer to the API.\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-details.png)](images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-details.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nOf significance here is the use of singletons. There are two singletons in play - one for the client, and one for the wrapper. Not only are the singletons used as the reference from the client to the wrapper and/or client library objects - but they are also used for communications between BrainCloudWrapper and BrainCloudClient.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight, although our intentions were good - this usage of singletons was a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cons (as we now see them) are:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Complicates the client code (calling the static class methods to retrieve a reference to the wrapper and or client object is more painful than using a direct global of some sort)\\r\\n- Complicates the documented code examples\\r\\n- Restricts a client to have one-and-only-one connection to the brainCloud server\xa0[ _this is a crippling restriction for some use cases - couch co-op anyone?_\xa0]\\r\\n\\r\\n## The fix\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, we are fixing this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-new.png)](images/braincloud-client-api-architecture-new.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes to the new client libraries are three-fold:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `BrainCloudWrapper`\xa0objects now have their own reference to their associated `BrainCloudClient`\xa0companions\\r\\n- `BrainCloudWrapper`\xa0objects also now provide direct methods for accessing the client services:\xa0you no longer have to call _wrapper\xa0\u2192 client\xa0\u2192 service\xa0\u2192 operation_, instead it is simply _wrapper\xa0\u2192 service\xa0\u2192 operation_\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is that instead of your client code looking like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n`BrainCloudWrapper.Instance.GetBC().LeaderboardService.ListAllLeaderboards( ApiSuccess, ApiError);`\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n`_bc.LeaderboardService.ListAllLeaderboards( ApiSuccess, ApiError);`\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Changes\\r\\n\\r\\nSo - more flexibility and clearer code? What\'s the catch?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catch is that you need to make a few changes to your client to get this goodness. For new apps it\'s no big deal at all - this could be a pain for existing apps though, so we are still including a legacy singleton mode in the client libraries - but that needs to be specifically enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\n_**Update: Legacy Singleton Mode has been removed from brainCloud client libraries beginning with 4.0.**_ \\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the steps to getting your app working using the updated libraries\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Grab the latest brainCloud client library from the portal via the\xa0**Team | Client Libs** page.\\r\\n2. Create an instance of\xa0`BrainCloudWrapper` and save it to a global accessible throughout your client app. In our documentation examples we use\xa0\\\\_bc, but it can be anything\\r\\n3. Adjust any client code to use this new reference - try searching and replacing\\r\\n    1. \\"BrainCloudWrapper.Client.\\"\xa0\u2192 \\"\\\\_bc.\\"\\r\\n    2. \\"BrainCloudClient.Instance.\\"\xa0\u2192 \\"\\\\_bc.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\'s about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote - you can optionally specify a \\\\__wrapperName_\xa0to use creating the wrapper. This name will be used as a key when storing data about the session, like the anonymousId and profileId.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou only need to specify the _\\\\_wrapperName_ if you are implementing a client with multiple concurrent connections to the brainCloud server (to help keep the session data separate). _**In particular, if you are updating an existing app, do not specify a profile-name - this ensures that the user does not lose their saved profile references when they upgrade to the latest version of your app!**_\\r\\n\\r\\n```csharp\\r\\n_bc = new BrainCloudWrapper(); // optionally pass in a _wrapperName\\r\\n_bc.initialize(_appId, _secret, _appVersion);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```csharp\\r\\n_bc = go.AddComponent&lt;BrainCloudWrapper&gt;();\\r\\n_bc.WrapperName = \\"_example\\"; // optionally set a wrapper-name\\r\\n_bc.Init();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Legacy Singleton Mode\\r\\n\\r\\n_**Update: Legacy Singleton Mode has been removed from brainCloud client libraries beginning with 4.0.**_ \\r\\n\\r\\nWant to move to the new libraries, but change as little code as possible? No worries, we have you covered. Here\'s what you do:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Grab the latest brainCloud client library\xa0from the portal via the\xa0**Team | Client Libs** page.\\r\\n2. Turn on legacy singleton mode via the `BrainCloudClient.EnableSingletonMode()`\xa0API call. Put the call in your code right before you initialize the library.\\r\\n3. Unity only (and only if you were using the `Client`\xa0static class accessor): Adjust any calls to `BrainCloudWrapper.Client.aService().anOperation()`\xa0to use `BrainCloudWrapper.Instance.Client.aService().anOperation()`\xa0instead (Note the additional Instance step).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following code snippet shows how to enable singleton mode in various languages:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```csharp\\r\\nBrainCloudClient.EnableSingletonMode = true;  // Turn on legacy singleton mode\\r\\nBrainCloudWrapper.getInstance().initialize(_appId, _secret, _appVersion);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```csharp\\r\\nBrainCloudClient.EnableSingletonMode = true;  // Turn on legacy singleton mode\\r\\nBrainCloudWrapper.getInstance().Init();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, thats the summary of what we have changed, and why.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope you agree that the improvements to functionality and readability are worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any feedback or concerns, feel free to hit the chat link and let us know.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheers!"},{"id":"/2017/01/30/introducing-global-tournaments","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2017/01/30/introducing-global-tournaments","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2017-01-30-introducing-global-tournaments/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2017-01-30-introducing-global-tournaments/index.md","title":"Introducing Global Tournaments","description":"Introduction","date":"2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 30, 2017","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":7.465,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Introducing Global Tournaments","date":"2017-01-30","authors":"paul","tags":["blog"],"coverImage":"Tournament-Entities-Simplified.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Wrappers, Clients and Inconvenient Singletons...","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2017/12/12/wrappers-clients-and-inconvenient-singletons"},"nextItem":{"title":"Parse and who can you trust?","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2016/01/30/parse-and-who-can-you-trust"}},"content":"## Introduction\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud\'s new\xa0**Global Tournaments**\xa0feature is an entirely new system designed to amplify player engagement in your games.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Global Tournaments_\xa0are suitable for any game where competition centres around\xa0_leaderboards_. In fact, in their simplest version,\xa0_Global Tournaments_\xa0can be thought of simply as\xa0_prize rules_\xa0associated with a\xa0_leaderboard_.\\r\\n\\r\\n_But as you will see, there is actually a whole lot more to them._\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Goals\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen designing\xa0**Global Tournaments**, we had a specific set of goals in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud\'s Global Tournaments should:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Be\xa0_easy_\xa0to add to apps\\r\\n- Be\xa0_flexible_\xa0in terms of tournament schedule, phases, rules, payouts, etc.\\r\\n- Integrate with brainCloud\'s existing\xa0_reward_\xa0systems\\r\\n- _Automate_\xa0key aspects of player engagement\\r\\n- Be\xa0_manageable_\xa0so that entry fees, prize amounts, etc. can change over time as you iterate\\r\\n- Act as building blocks for building more complex tournament types (i.e. tiered tournaments, etc.)\\r\\n- Work within the existing brainCloud pricing tiers\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Features\\r\\n\\r\\n**Global Tournaments**\xa0support the following key features:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Duration**\xa0- support for daily, weekly, and arbitrary length tournaments (up to 14 days)\\r\\n- **Phases**\xa0- support for optional\xa0_announcement_,\xa0_enrollment_,\xa0_competition_,\xa0_buffer_\xa0and\xa0_award_\xa0phases\\r\\n- **Flexible Prizes**\xa0- Award participants any combination of\xa0_virtual currency_,\xa0_xp_,\xa0_player stats_,\xa0_achievements_\xa0and\xa0_custom data_\\r\\n- **Entry fees**\xa0- Free vs. Paid Tournaments\\r\\n- **Push Notifications**\xa0- automatically send configurable push notifications at key points during the tournament\\r\\n- **Email Integration**\xa0- send custom email notifications as well\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Design\\r\\n\\r\\n### Concepts\\r\\n\\r\\nThis diagram describes the main entities involved in creating a Tournament:\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/Tournament-Entities-Simplified.png)](images/Tournament-Entities-Simplified.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Leaderboards are defined in the brainCloud system by entities we call _Leaderboard Configs_\\r\\n- To create a tournament, you attach a\xa0_Tournament Template_\xa0to a\xa0_Leaderboard Config_\\r\\n- The\xa0_Tournament Template_\xa0defines the rules of a tournament - entry fees, prize rules, notification templates, etc.\\r\\n- The\xa0_Leaderboard Config_\xa0defines how scoring works (highest score, cumulative score, etc), the rotation schedule, and also the\xa0_pacing of the tournament phases_.\\r\\n- Each rotation of the leaderboard is a\xa0_Leaderboard Version_. All scores are stored by version in _Leaderboard Entry_ objects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial rules:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The same\xa0_tournament template_\xa0may be used by\xa0_multiple leaderboards_. This of course creates a separate tournament per leaderboard.\\r\\n- A leaderboard may also attach\xa0_multiple tournament templates_. This is useful for cases where you want to have both free and paid versions of a tournament, that act upon the same set of scores. (_rationale: better liquidity, smaller payouts_)\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tournament interactions / api\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are the key tournament interactions to understand:\\r\\n\\r\\n- _Get Tournament Status_\xa0- returns the status of the specified tournament, and whether the player is currently enrolled in it. If the player is not enrolled, returns details of\xa0_all_ the tournament configs associated with the leaderboard\\r\\n- _Join Tournament_\xa0- all tournaments must be joined before you can submit scores to them. Joining a tournament involves specifying the leaderboard that anchors the tournament, and the\xa0`tCode`\xa0of the tournament [template] that you are joining.\xa0_An entry fee will automatically be deducted from the player\'s currency balance if required._\\r\\n- _Post Tournament Score_\xa0- posts an score to the tournament leaderboard. Note that you must pass in the epoch time that the game round started in, to ensure that the score is eligible. _Note that there are\xa0several versions of this operation (see the API for details)._\\r\\n- _View Current Reward_\xa0- returns the player\'s standing in the currently active tournament, and the reward they can expect to receive if they keep this rank.\\r\\n- _View Reward_\xa0- returns the players reward for a completed tournament, and whether it has already been claimed. Will return an error if the player is not enrolled in the tournament.\\r\\n- [_Check For Events_](/api/capi/event/getevents) - query the brainCloud events queue to see if any Tournament Completion events have arrived\\r\\n- _Claim Tournament Reward_\xa0- claims the rewards for a completed tournament, incrementing appropriate player balances (currencies, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information\xa0on these interactions, see the [Tournament API](/api/capi/tournament).\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n### Phases and States\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tournament States_ are used to organize the larger tournament lifecycle. They determine when tournaments are active, processing award calculations, and available for award clams.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Tournament Phases_ help to micro-manage when players can join tournaments, post scores, etc. throughout the Active tournament state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following diagram summarizes the relationship between brainCloud tournament states and phases:\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/Tournament-States-and-Phases.png)](images/Tournament-States-and-Phases.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note that brainCloud doesn\'t explicitly tell you the phase\xa0it is in - instead,\xa0it gives you information as to when registration starts and ends, when play starts and ends, etc._\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n### Events and Notifications\\r\\n\\r\\nA key goal of brainCloud\'s Global Tournaments system is to automate the tournaments interactions with players. As such, the system:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Automatically rotates and cycles through tournament states and phases as per the schedule defined\\r\\n- Send events to players when the tournament has completed\\r\\n- Optionally sends push notifications and/or emails\\r\\n    - When a\xa0new tournament opens for registration (enrollment) - sent to previous tournament participants\\r\\n    - When a new tournament opens for play (competition) - sent to previous and currently registered participants\\r\\n    - When a tournament\'s competition phase is close to ending - sent to current participants\\r\\n    - When another player beats their tournament score, bumping them down a rank - sent to current participants within 10 ranks of the player who posted the score\\r\\n    - When a tournament completes and they\'re awards are ready to be claimed - sent to current participants. The system also sends an Event to the player\'s event queue.\\r\\n\\r\\n[![](images/2017-01-29_23-22-52.png)](images/2017-01-29_23-22-52.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that you shouldn\'t blindly configure all notifications - especially the email-based notifications. Some recommendations:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Obviously, do not configure both Tournament Registration start and Tournament Play start if your tournament doesn\'t have an exclusive registration period, or your players will get two back-to-back notifications, and be annoyed.\\r\\n- Be careful about configuring Email-based notifications - we\'ve included the trigger points, but for most cases we would recommend that you mostly use them to announce that a tournament is complete and that the player should come collect their prize. It\'s also a handy opportunity to include info on other game offers, bonuses items to increase scores, etc.\\r\\n- Be aware that brainCloud does not yet support automated unsubscribes\xa0(coming soon)\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Special: Scoring notifications\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two types of designers. Designers who think that scoring notifications are cool, and those that think they could get annoying very quickly. And they are both right.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo add the engagement of scoring notifications, hopefully without overwhelming the player, we\'ve added the following rules:\\r\\n\\r\\n- We\'ll only send a player\xa0_one_\xa0scoring notification per 24-hour period\\r\\n\\r\\nThe are two additional rules that affect this:\\r\\n\\r\\n- If you post a new score, we reset the notification clock. This means that engaged players\xa0_will_\xa0receive more than one notification in a 24 hour period, because they\'re actually responding to them.\\r\\n- We won\'t send the player a score update until at least 30 minutes after their last posted score (i.e. you don\'t want to receive a push notification\xa0_immediately_\xa0after exiting the game)\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Bonus Features: Auto Join and Auto Reward\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal Tournaments\xa0offer an incredible way to increase engagement and monetization with your players -\xa0but\xa0what if you are just looking for a quick way to automatically add rewards to your weekly leaderboards - without code changes?\\r\\n\\r\\nLook no further - brainCloud has two new features that\xa0allow you to automate the key portions of the tournament processing:\\r\\n\\r\\n- _Auto Join_ - Enables\xa0players to automatically join the tournament associated with a leaderboard, simply by posting a score to it (via the standard leaderboard PostScore method). Note that this only works for leaderboards that have _one-and-only-one tournament_ associated with them - and that tournament must be _free_.\\r\\n- _Auto Claim_ - Causes tournament rewards to be automatically claimed by players during login. Note that the _[x] Enable Tournament Auto Claim check at login_ compatibility flag\xa0must also be enabled on the Design | Core App Info | Advanced page of the portal\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note - although we provide the Auto Join and Auto Claim features for convenience, in most cases we would definitely recommend that you implement the full tournament API. A key benefit to tournaments is engaging with your players - getting them excited about what they can win and adding that extra flourish as they claim their prizes. Auto Join and Auto Claim hide all that - minimizing\xa0the opportunity\xa0for extra player engagement._\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Features Availability and Billing Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal Tournaments are available across all brainCloud subscription plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic API billing rules are in effect - 1 API count per API call, 1 API count per Push Notification, 1 API count per Email Sent\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the following counts are added to offset the overheads of automated tournaments:\\r\\n\\r\\n- _Awards Calculation_ - At the end of the tournament, 1\xa0Bulk API Count _per participant_ is charged to cover the CPU load of processing results and sending events to the players\\r\\n- [_PostTournamentScoreWithResultsUTC()_](/api/capi/tournament/posttournamentscorewithresultsutc)\xa0- adds 1\xa0Bulk API count to cover the overhead of comparing the players previous and current tournament results, and determining whether to send notifications to displaced players. As compensation, however, returns the updated tournament results (essentially [GetGlobalLeaderboardView()](/api/capi/leaderboard/getgloballeaderboardview)), hopefully saving the app an API call in return.\\r\\n- Auto Claim - if the Auto-Claim feature is enabled, 0.5\xa0Bulk API Counts are\xa0added to each Authentication()"},{"id":"/2016/01/30/parse-and-who-can-you-trust","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2016/01/30/parse-and-who-can-you-trust","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2016-01-30-parse-and-who-can-you-trust/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2016-01-30-parse-and-who-can-you-trust/index.md","title":"Parse and who can you trust?","description":"Parse and who can you trust?","date":"2016-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 30, 2016","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":7.14,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Parse and who can you trust?","date":"2016-01-30","authors":"paul","tags":["blog"],"coverImage":"braincloud_a_backend_brain.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing Global Tournaments","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2017/01/30/introducing-global-tournaments"},"nextItem":{"title":"Launch Tip #1: Version Enforcement","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2015/11/10/launch-tip-1-version-enforcement"}},"content":"## Parse and who can you trust?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, Facebook dropped a [bomb](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/facebook-to-shut-down-parse-its-platform-for-mobile-developers/?_r=0). They announced that they were [shutting down\xa0Parse](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/), the Mobile\xa0Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) platform that they acquired in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nParse is one of brainCloud\'s competitors, and arguably the biggest and most established player in the BaaS industry. Even so, brainCloud doesn\'t\xa0run up against them _that_ much because we\xa0have a richer, more specialized\xa0featureset that works better for our customer base.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of this event, it is inevitable that people are asking\xa0\\"What happened?\\" and \\"How can we trust any BaaS to build our business upon\\". To that end, I thought I\'d put together a few thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why was Parse shut down?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internet is a-buzz with\xa0comments that _the business must have been failing_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t buy that. The business case for the Backend-as-a-Service market\xa0is very strong, and Parse had a good product for the space they were aimed at. By all accounts, they had plenty of customers and an overall strong business. So why close it?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that Parse no longer aligned with the goals of it\'s parent company, Facebook.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time that Parse was acquired, Facebook was floundering. They had recently IPO\'d, but hadn\'t figured out their mobile and advertising strategy. The stock was down, revenues were down - and they made a series of acquisitions hoping to strengthen and diversify their portfolio. Parse,\xa0well positioned as a platform for enabling mobile apps, seemed like a smart play to help them build up their mobile presence. And I\'d say it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, almost three years later, things have changed. Facebook has totally turned it\'s ship around. It is now a [juggernaught in mobile](http://marketingland.com/nielsen-top-apps-of-2015-dominated-by-facebook-google-apple-156694), has advertising sales through the roof, and is more focused than ever on building out its\xa0core product. In managing everything it is doing, Facebook needs to continually ask itself: \\"Is <x\\\\> strategic to our overall success?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I think that\'s where Parse failed the test. Parse\'s business was probably $50-$100M per year. Healthy, for sure - heck, we\'d take it! But that\'s just a drop in the bucket to Facebook (less than 1% of revenue!), which will net close to $20B this year. And yet, I\'ll bet that division\xa0had some of Facebook\'s best engineers!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\'s what it comes down to - Facebook said as much in their blog post. They are going to **[\\"focus their resources elsewhere.\\"](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/)** I don\'t\xa0think this is the normal generic\xa0excuse that a company makes when they announce bad news - in this case, I believe that it is very _literally_ what they are doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Who can\xa0you trust?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of the Parse shut-down, a lot of people will be wondering how they can put their trust in any Backend-as-a-Service. After all, a ton of people probably chose Parse specifically because it was run by Facebook - a huge, incredibly successful organization, that\xa0was guaranteed to be around for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is my\xa0suggestion on the evaluation criteria to consider:\\r\\n\\r\\n[![parse_and_who_can_you_trust_](images/Parse_and_who_can_you_trust_.png)](images/Parse_and_who_can_you_trust_.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n1. _**Feature Set**_ - always\xa0start with the features\xa0- there is no point in going for a solution that doesn\'t meet your needs.\\r\\n2. _**Organization**_ - consider\xa0the organization that develops it. Are they a long-standing, established business, that has earned a solid reputation in the marketplace?\\r\\n3. _**Funding**_ - how is the company/product funded? **Beware of purely VC-funded companies.**\xa0A lot of BaaS vendors are early stage VC-funded - this makes for splashy million dollar announcements and marketing materials, but the funding comes with strings attached, in terms of _\\"You must succeed by <x\\\\> or you will be shut down.\\"_\\r\\n4. _**Business Model**_ -\xa0does the business model make sense? Is it easy to understand how the business would make money for the organization? If not, be wary - a _\\"too good to be true\\"_business model is often a sign of a last-ditch \\"hail mary\\" throw for success.\\r\\n5. _**Alignment**_ - Does the product align with the strategic goals of the parent organization. No matter how good the product, Facebook has just proven that you are in danger if a clear alignment isn\'t there.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven this critera, how does brainCloud rate?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. _**Feature Set**_\xa0- we pride ourselves on our features, and the rapid pace at which they are\xa0evolving. With brainCloud (especially in comparison to a lower-level offering\xa0like Parse), you spend _less time building features and more time using them_. And we match each new feature with a visual tool for configuring and managing it.brainCloud goes over-and-above the classic BaaS capabilities with support for Gamification (xp, milestones, quests, achievements, leaderboards, etc.), Segmented Push Notifications, Scheduled Cloud Code, Auto\xa0Promotions, Mobile Multiplayer, Shared User Accounts, External Authentication, Server-to-Server APIs, a dynamic DataStream Architecture, and much much more.\\r\\n2. _**Organization**_ - brainCloud is built by [bitHeads](http://www.bitheads.com/), a 20-year old\xa0technology\xa0software developer based in Ottawa, Canada, in conjunction with [playBrains](http://www.playbrains.com/), our game development subsidiary. bitHeads has earned a reputation as one of the top software development companies in Canada, and through the years has built award-winning products for Microsoft, Sony, Blackberry, Canada Post, Samsung, E\\\\*Trade, Nortel, Mitel, and hundreds of others.\\r\\n3. _**Funding**_ - brainCloud is privately funded by bitHeads, its parent organization, with some assistance from various Canadian government programs. We are privately controlled, and thus no ultimatums.We started building brainCloud over four\xa0years ago, well before the term BaaS or MBaaS was a thing.\xa0We saw\xa0the value and opportunity in this market back then, and are determined to build the best product for it.\\r\\n4. _**Business Model**_ - we don\'t give brainCloud away, but we do work to keep the cost of the service as low as possible. brainCloud is free for development (maximum 100 dau), but you pay starting at $30 / month once you go live. _This minimal charge ensures that every brainCloud customer is pulling their weight and paying their share of the costs for the service._ This allows us to offer lower prices than our competitors, while at the same time ensuring that\xa0_bitHeads can operate brainCloud indefinitely._[![bc_parse_model](images/bc_parse_model.png)](images/bc_parse_model.png)Contrast that with the models of some of our competitors, and ask yourselves how they can possibly be successful in the mid-to-long term? They have to charge their paid users more, and are basically betting that they will have enough high-volume customers to pay for the inevitably huge number of low-volume customers (that they subsidize for free). And some models are even crazier!\xa0_These are the\xa0sorts of bets that you make when you are desperate\xa0for your next round of VC funding, or looking to be bought_.\\r\\n5. _**Alignment**_ - brainCloud arose because bitHeads was constantly building custom backend solutions for our customers. And we were building them over-and-over again, with largely the same features. For online casinos. Retail networks. Telecommunications. Mobile/Social games. For twenty years.Four years ago, we finally said, wait - what if we did this once, and productized it, so that we (nor anyone else) has to keep re-inventing the wheel? And thus brainCloud was born. It started as a small, separate team working within the company to build the core server system. We released the first apps on the platform almost three years ago - before we had a design portal with which to design and manage things (configuration was CSV and JSON\xa0back then).Today the team consists of twenty-ish people within the larger bitHeads/playBrains organization, together with the support teams to make that work. All services teams at bitHeads are aligned to delivering products and services around brainCloud.\xa0The custom apps and games that we build today are built upon brainCloud - it\'s our competitive advantage. And we continue to productize and evolve the platform based on the feedback of our great community of developers.There\'s no fear of alignment here - bitHeads _is_ brainCloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there you have it - my take on Parse, and how bitHeads\xa0and brainCloud rate as a Backend-as-a-Server that you can trust. To our\xa0brainCloud customers today, thanks a bunch - rest assured, we are in this for the long haul.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if this is your first exposure to brainCloud, please [sign up](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/signup#/) and take a look for free. If\xa0you take a good look at our features and tools, we think you\'ll realize the power of the system we\'ve developed, and the passion of the folks building it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh - and\xa0if you are looking to move from Parse, please [check out this survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/W93BKYC). Filling it out will help us to prioritize the tools and support processes that we\'re developing to assist\xa0Parse migration.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy coding folks!\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul.\\r\\n\\r\\n_(PS - And for all you Parse-based folks looking to move, feel free to reach out. Our services teams would be happy to help you move over to our platform!)_"},{"id":"/2015/11/10/launch-tip-1-version-enforcement","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2015/11/10/launch-tip-1-version-enforcement","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2015-11-10-launch-tip-1-version-enforcement/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-11-10-launch-tip-1-version-enforcement/index.md","title":"Launch Tip #1: Version Enforcement","description":"Launch Tip 1: Version Enforcement","date":"2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 10, 2015","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":2.71,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Launch Tip #1: Version Enforcement","date":"2015-11-10","authors":"paul","tags":["blog"],"coverImage":"braincloud_a_backend_brain.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"Parse and who can you trust?","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2016/01/30/parse-and-who-can-you-trust"},"nextItem":{"title":"brainCloud at GDC!","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2015/02/19/braincloud-at-gdc"}},"content":"## Launch Tip #1: Version Enforcement\\r\\n\\r\\n_This post is the first\xa0of our new series on best practices to observe\xa0before launching your app._\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s an exciting feeling...

Go to **Design | Core App Info | Platforms**, and temporarily set the minimum app version to something higher than your current app version.\\r\\n3. Enhance the Authentication error handling of your app to catch the out-of-date\xa0error response\xa0(see the _Version Enhancement_ section of the [Authentication API](/api/capi/authentication/) page for details) - and display an appropriate message to the user.\xa0_Ideally you should redirect the user to your apps store page so that he/she can trigger the update immediately. The brainCloud portal allows you to datafill the upgrade URL along with the minimum version._\\r\\n4. Test to ensure that it works!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\'s it.

For those customers, pitching brainCloud is simply a question of Build vs. Buy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, brainCloud offers a \\\\*lot\\\\* more than just multiplayer and social features - features that greatly aid in the management and monetization of any free-to-play game... \xa0so lets dig deeper and do the full analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Background\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, a bit of background on the game in question:\\r\\n\\r\\n- It\'s a freemium mobile game on **iOS** and **Android**\\r\\n- The game is successful, and doing roughly 50K DAU, with about $0.02 ARPDAU\\r\\n- Monetization is via in-app-purchases for speeding up the accrual of key stats and in-game currencies - progressing the meta-game\\r\\n- There are no social features - no leaderboards, etc.\\r\\n- The game is integrated with no cloud tech, other than analytics and some advertising - so no cloud saves, etc...\\r\\n- It\'s a very small team - 1-3 devs really - so time is money\\r\\n\\r\\nSo - what benefits cloud features have to offer a game like this? \xa0And do the benefits out-weigh the impact of adding the new monthly cloud service costs?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s easy to argue that their player base will grow and become more engaged if you add cloud saves (so players can play across devices), social leaderboards (to compete against friends), published achievements, player vs. player challenges, etc... \xa0but it\'s impossible to predict (or later prove) what the monetary impact of those incremental improvements might be... \xa0[plus, in this case there\'s an existing product and customer base - so greatly evolving the game storage and socialization strategies might be disruptive].\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead - lets take this from a purely monetization perspective. \xa0One of the key focuses of brainCloud is not just providing the bread-and-butter of cloud tech - but also providing a platform that allows you to really increase the monetization of free-to-play games.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo - focusing just on the freemium monetization features - what minimal integration efforts would result in maximum return for the game?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key features I\'d suggest are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **IAP Validation** - brainCloud provides server-side receipt validation, which eliminates IAP piracy, resulting in a boost to IAP sales. \xa0Let\'s be conservative and predict a **5% boost** to IAP revenue as a result. \xa0[For some background, see this\xa0[GamaSutra article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AaronIsaksen/20121213/183519/Piracy_Tracking_for_InApp_Purchases.php) regarding IAP piracy.]\\r\\n2. **Scheduled Promotions** - brainCloud provides certralized coordination of pricing and promotions, across platforms. \xa0And brainCloud supports scheduling of promotions - and automated sending of **push notifications** to inform the user base of the promotions as they happen. \xa0Sure this is stuff a product manager can coordinate manually - but when you\'re a small company, you tend to focus on the new products and leave the old ones to fend for themselves. \xa0It\'s fair to expect say **2.5% boost** from allowing brainCloud to do this for you.\\r\\n3. **Automated [Targeted] Promotions** - finally, brainCloud allows you to aim targeted promotions and dynamic player segments. \xa0This means, you can define a player segment for \\"VIPs that are leaving the game\\" - and hit them with a special promotion to get them to stay. \xa0Given that whales are responsible for 80% of revenue for most games, extending that stay should be easily worth another **5% boost**.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would only take a week or two to add these features to the game (plus a bit of testing of course).\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Math\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is currently bringing in about $30K USD per month (50,000 DAU x 0.02 ARPDAU x 30 days). \xa0A 12.5% increase on the monetization results in an additional $3,750 USD per month.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut... \xa0now there are [brainCloud] server costs - so we\'ve got to factor that in.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking closely at [brainCloud pricing](http://getbraincloud.com/pricing/), you can see that 50K users is estimated at about $1600 USD per month - which seems pretty reasonable given the benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wait, that\'s assuming 100 brainCloud API calls per DAU - if the game is only using brainCloud for monetizaiton, it\'s API usage will be way, way down - we\'re probably talking 5-10 API calls per DAU (and that\'s assuming players are playing multiple sessions a day).\\r\\n\\r\\nLets say it\'s 10 API calls per DAU. \xa0In a month, that would be only 10 x 50,000 x 30 = 15M calls - which is actually only $150 / month\\\\*. \xa0Talk about a bargain! :)\\r\\n\\r\\n_\\\\* and that\'s before the early adopter discounts!_\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Results\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, the moral of the story is, _there\'s always room for increased monetization_.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur estimates are that for a cost of 10 days of integration, plus $150 monthly for brainCloud, the developer will see a 12.5% increase in sales, which in this case is a monthly increase of almost $3600 USD per month.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the increase were over-estimated by a factor of 10x it would still be worth it in the long term...\\r\\n\\r\\nCool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\n## One Final Note\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pricing analysis points out one of the greatest aspects of the brainCloud pricing model - you just pay for the amount of the service you use (in millions of API calls), not for the amount of the service that the provider fears you \\\\*might\\\\* use.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Utilizing these same features from competing platforms at 50K DAU could cost as much as $3000 / month!**\\r\\n\\r\\n_Makes brainCloud seem like quite the deal, doesn\'t it?

Want to use brainCloud for cloud saves only? \xa0No problem. \xa0brainCloud monetization features\xa0only? Go nuts - and pay less because you\'re utilizing our servers less!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, we\'ve had apps in our network use less than 10 transactions per DAU, and some use upwards of 200 API calls per DAU. \xa0We\'ve not yet had an app average greater than 300 API calls per DAU.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd note, brainCloud includes tools to help you assess and optimize your API Usage - to keep your costs (and our server usage) down. \xa0Our costs go down, and your costs go down - **win:win!**\\r\\n\\r\\n\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n## Free during development\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope this clears up any questions you may have about pricing in brainCloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n**As always, brainCloud is free during development (up to 100 users), and if you sign up before March 6th, 2015, you lock in our special Early Adopter pricing until 2016!**\\r\\n\\r\\n[otw\\\\_shortcode\\\\_button size=\\"large\\" icon\\\\_position=\\"left\\" shape=\\"square\\"]Sign Up For Free[/otw\\\\_shortcode\\\\_button]"},{"id":"/2014/11/12/bitheads-announces-braincloud","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2014/11/12/bitheads-announces-braincloud","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2014-11-12-bitheads-announces-braincloud/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-11-12-bitheads-announces-braincloud/index.md","title":"bitHeads announces brainCloud","description":"bitHeads announces brainCloud, a new revolutionary cloud solution for game developers","date":"2014-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 12, 2014","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":4.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"bitHeads announces brainCloud","date":"2014-11-12","authors":"paul","tags":["blog"],"coverImage":"braincloud_announcement.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"brainCloud Pricing Update!","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2014/12/01/braincloud-pricing-update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Unity Tutorial #1 - Getting Started","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/2014/11/08/unity-tutorial-1-getting-started"}},"content":"### bitHeads announces brainCloud, a new revolutionary cloud solution for game developers\\r\\n\\r\\n_Leading games technology company today announced the industry-wide availability of brainCloud, a streamlined backend solution for comprehensive, cloud-based game management._\\r\\n\\r\\nOttawa, Ontario, and Montreal International Games Summit (MIGS), Nov 12, 2014 -- Previously only available to select game developers, bitHeads has officially launched brainCloud to support backend development and build revenue opportunities for game developers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn out-of-the box solution for game development and management challenges, brainCloud is set to revolutionize the interactive games industry.brainCloud is a robust backend cloud-based production toolset that cuts game development time and costs by providing a one-stop solution that manages multiplayer features, monetization, cross-platform analytics, promotions, sales, and more. brainCloud works seamlessly with existing tools to operate and grow a game developers\u2019 core business.\\r\\n\\r\\nDramatic shifts in mobile game development over the last five years demand fast-paced development that integrates innovative tools and drive user engagement while providing effective analytics and monetization strategies. To be commercially viable, games require multi-platform and multi-network support, game management systems, deployment, and advanced analytics. Addressing this need, brainCloud is an advanced solution within the emerging category of the cloud-based platform tools for games development.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey brainCloud features include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Game Features** - multiplayer, matchmaking, cloud-saves, identity management, social integration, leaderboards, achievements, push notifications, virtual currencies, and in-app purchasing. Using the JavaScript-supported brainCloud Cloud Code feature, developers are able to build in additional features.\\r\\n- **Local Platform Integration** - when a player is awarded an Achievement in brainCloud, that achievement is also triggered in iOS GameCenter.\\r\\n- **Advanced Pricing and Promotional Features** - brainCloud provides support for multiple virtual currencies and coordinates the product and pricing management across all platforms, allowing the developer to quickly put items on sale with just a few clicks.\\r\\n- **Scheduled Promotions** - sales can be pre-configured well into the future and when the promotion automatically triggers, players will receive notifications on their devices (in their language), and automatically get the preferential pricing when they go into their store screens.\\r\\n- **Advanced Auto Promotions** - developers are able to define dynamic target segments of users and trigger individual promotions just for them. For example, a developer could define a promotion for \u201cMVPs that may be leaving the game\u201d - and define the criteria as \u201cplayers who\u2019ve played > 50 times, who\u2019ve spent > $20, and who haven\u2019t played in the past 5 days\u201d. Whenever a player enters this segment, a special \u201cPromotion for MVPs\u201d would be triggered, offering them a product at a huge discount, in an attempt to keep them in the game longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAuto Promotions are just the beginning of the sort of advanced monetization features that bitHeads has in store for brainCloud,\u201d notes brainCloud product manager Paul Winterhalder. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit to the sort of advanced features that we can build to help developers to better engage and monetize their communities.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Having worked with the team at brainCloud on multiple projects, they definitely know their stuff when it comes highly-scalable back-ends,\u201d says Stu Duncan, founder of Bight Games, the creators of \'The Simpsons: Tapped Out\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cBefore building our latest game, Project Cyber, we looked at a number of backend-as-a-service platforms. None of them had as complete a game feature set as brainCloud\u201d, says Spearhead Games co-founder Atul Mehra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWanda Meloni, CEO of M2 Research explains, \\"Solutions such as brainCloud now offer small-to-mid-size developers the sort of back-end infrastructure previously only available to larger developers such as Zynga, King.com and Supercell. Providing an out-of-the-box solution, bitHeads and brainCloud are really leveling the playing field.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOutlining key findings from M2 Research\u2019s upcoming State of Game Development Report Meloni notes, \u201cIndependent developers with less than 25 employees now make up 62% of the games development market, while mid to large scale indies represent another 13%. With 75% of the total game development market made up of independent teams, optimizing backend infrastructure is critical for developers looking to build in cross-platform development, monetization and ultimately cost savings.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"bitHeads has been building customized backend solutions for clients since 1995. The growth and need in the market is there, and with brainCloud we have built a robust and scalable platform that helps developers concentrate on what they do best - make great games. We help them get games out faster, save on development, hosting and maintenance costs, and have built-in features specifically created to increase revenue,\\" says Scott Simpson, CEO of bitHeads.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopers who sign up before December 31, 2014 qualify for special early adopter pricing until 2016.
