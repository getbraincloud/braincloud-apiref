That said, we want to assure all GameSparks customers and partners that brainCloud can offer all developers (from hobbyists, startups, and big studios alike) an alternative to ensure efficient and full migration to prevent downtime for their players.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most of you know, we launched brainCloud in 2014 and have been supporting all kinds of indies and big studios since then. We\u2019ve also recently been working as a solution integrator in collaboration with Amazon Game Tech to assist GameSparks deprecation efforts and existing GameSparks customer migration.\\r\\n\\r\\nbrainCloud has a robust, comparable feature set that includes popular GameSparks features like Player and Game Management, Cloud Scripts, Leaderboards, Achievements, Messaging, Virtual Goods & Currencies, and Real-time features like Lobbies, Matchmaking, Notifications, and Chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, brainCloud also has advanced features not implemented in GameSparks like Custom Room & Relay Servers for real-time multiplayer, Tournaments, Blockchain Integration, Segments, Profanity Filters, Pricing and Promotion features, Playback Streams and connectivity to virtually any data collection or storage application through our Datastream service.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course, brainCloud supports all popular mobile and console platforms, including built-in Oculus support. We even have APIs to help migrate your users over to our back-end. And of particular interest to ex-GameSparks folks, we are happy to announce that Amazon GameLift integration will be added to brainCloud this fall!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this is available via a variety of licensing options that range from monthly BaaS subscriptions all the way up to private and platform licensing. All with world-class support and available professional services.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe encourage all existing GameSparks customers to check out brainCloud and let us know how we can help you migrate and grow your games on all platforms. We are here to help. Just sign up \u2013 brainCloud is free during development!\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy Coding,\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul from brainCloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n( PS \u2013 For more information, check out our [GameSparks Migration FAQ](https://help.getbraincloud.com/en/articles/5441729-gamesparks-migration-faq). )"},{"id":"apple-facebook-privacy-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/apple-facebook-privacy-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-apiref/tree/main/blog/2021-03-11-apple-facebook-privacy/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-11-apple-facebook-privacy/index.md","title":"Apple iOS 14.5 Privacy & Facebook Limited Login mode","description":"Apple is introducing comprehensive changes to iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and tvOS 14.5 that will require apps to ask users for their permission to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.","date":"2021-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 11, 2021","tags":[{"label":"bitheads","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/bitheads"},{"label":"braincloud","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/braincloud"},{"label":"apple","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/apple"},{"label":"facebook","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/facebook"},{"label":"pravicy","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/tags/pravicy"}],"readingTime":3.035,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Winterhalder","title":"brainCloud product owner","url":"https://github.com/winterhalder","imageURL":"https://github.com/winterhalder.png","key":"paul"},{"name":"Jason Liang","title":"software develop & technical specialist","url":"https://github.com/JasonZhLiang","imageURL":"https://github.com/JasonZhLiang.png","key":"jason"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"apple-facebook-privacy-post","title":"Apple iOS 14.5 Privacy & Facebook Limited Login mode","authors":["paul","jason"],"tags":["bitheads","braincloud","apple","facebook","pravicy"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Migrating From Gamesparks","permalink":"/braincloud-apiref/blog/migrating-from-gamesparks"}},"content":"Apple is introducing comprehensive changes to iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and tvOS 14.5 that will require apps to ask users for their permission to track them across apps and websites owned by other companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first glance, this seems like something that would mostly affect apps that are using user data for advertising-based monetization\u200a\u2014\u200abut in truth, the implications are deeper than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the record, we at brainCloud very much appreciate and advocate for user privacy. All user data associated with a brainCloud app is private to that app\u200a\u2014\u200athe data is not aggregated or shared across apps or companies in any way. So if your app is using brainCloud without 3rd party authentication, you can feel confident that that data is not being shared in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, brainCloud does support authentication-based integrations with third party providers\u200a\u2014\u200amost importantly Facebook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Frequently Asked Questions from the Apple page linked above clarify their guidance in this area:\\r\\n\\r\\n![apple privacy](1_XbJCJVzTBMjkaDlcmmmmgQ.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this interpretation, just offering a classic Facebook Account login for your app\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is prety standard practice\u200a\u2014\u200arequires you to get the user\u2019s permission for tracking across apps and websites owned by other companies. The rationale is that your app may not be sharing the data\u200a\u2014\u200abut Facebook itself certainly is.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from Facebook\u2019s objections to these changes (we don\u2019t want to get into that)\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook has offered a recommended technical solution\u200a\u2014\u200athey have extended their Facebook Login feature to include a new Limited Login Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n![facebook limited login](1_GcvS9VJr6EwWPf09xxP27w.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo\u200a\u2014\u200aLimited Login mode seems like a pretty good solution to this problem. There is a pretty big limitation here though. If users opt for the Limited Login mode, the app will not have access to the Graph API.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor games and social apps\u200a\u2014\u200athis is a pretty big limitation. It means that the app (and backend services like brainCloud that act on it\u2019s behalf) will lose the ability to query Facebook for the user\u2019s friends. This will have a huge impact on games that depend upon those sorts of social interactions for engagement and monetization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is therefore highly recommended that games pop-up their own informational message before Apple\u2019s built-in pop-up, to educate the user on any features that may become unavailable as a consequence of their choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother issue is that the identification information returned from the new Limited Login mode is different than with the Classic Login. This means that backend services, like brainCloud, need to implement changes to work with this new mode. The silver lining is that the underlying id of the user remains the same between the two modes\u200a\u2014\u200aso a user who flips back and forth between the two modes can still be associated with the same back-end account\u200a\u2014\u200aphew!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe at brainCloud are working hard to incorporate the necessary changes\u200a\u2014\u200aand will be releasing brainCloud 4.7 with Facebook Limited Login mode before the end of March 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few more details about the changes in brainCloud 4.7:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Full Support for Facebook Limited Login mode across the authentication + identity APIs. The same user using either mode will be linked to the same underlying brainCloud profile.\\r\\n- brainCloud will automatically handle the loss of the Graph API for Limited Login mode users\u200a\u2014\u200aso for example, users will simply appear to have no Facebook friends (instead of the client app having to deal with errors).\\r\\n- Coincidentally, brainCloud 4.7 will include new support for Steam and Playstation Network friends\u200a\u2014\u200aso apps can extend their friend support in other areas.\\r\\n- brainCloud already supports self-managed Friend APIs. See AddFriends(), ListFriends(), etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope that this helps to clarify the impact of these changs to iOS 14.5, and how brainCloud can help your apps to adapt."}]}')}}]);
